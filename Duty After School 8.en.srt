00:09.192 --> 00:10.588
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

00:10.612 --> 00:12.030
(in this drama are fictitious.)

00:19.872 --> 00:21.103
What is this?

00:21.372 --> 00:22.934
Why are they the only ones here?

00:23.042 --> 00:25.018
Did the prison officers really leave them behind?

00:25.042 --> 00:27.153
Who knows what happened?

00:27.961 --> 00:29.886
We can't trust what they say.

00:32.382 --> 00:33.757
From what I know,

00:34.092 --> 00:36.248
in times of war, they let the petty criminals go,

00:36.342 --> 00:38.497
and they transfer the hard criminals to Busan.

00:39.051 --> 00:41.617
All of those people must be hard criminals.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.538
Maybe that's why they were left here until the end and got stuck.

00:44.562 --> 00:46.212
You saw the red tag earlier, right?

00:46.772 --> 00:48.059
That means he's on death row.

00:48.062 --> 00:50.628
Then isn't he a serial killer or something?

00:50.652 --> 00:53.127
Darn it, he looked super scary.

00:56.071 --> 00:57.546
Maybe he's the boss of a gang,

00:58.071 --> 01:00.733
and he wiped out his enemy gang before getting locked up.

01:02.582 --> 01:04.888
Bring it on.

01:04.912 --> 01:06.227
Get lost.

01:06.251 --> 01:07.437
Darn it.

01:07.461 --> 01:08.977
Hey, guys.

01:09.001 --> 01:10.465
Are you still there?

01:10.751 --> 01:12.437
Come here and open these doors for me.

01:12.461 --> 01:14.988
Darn it! At this rate, we might actually die! Open up!

01:15.012 --> 01:16.488
Please, save us.

01:16.512 --> 01:18.447
We're not bad people, guys.

01:18.471 --> 01:19.947
- Come over here for a minute.
- Guys!

01:19.971 --> 01:21.408
- Come over here, - Hey, guys.

01:21.432 --> 01:23.312
And listen to us.

01:23.682 --> 01:26.708
We can never open the doors for them. They're dangerous people.

01:26.732 --> 01:28.328
- That's right.
- Guys!

01:28.352 --> 01:31.707
But they said they haven't even eaten for days.

01:32.822 --> 01:35.110
- Should we at least give them...
- Are you crazy?

01:35.232 --> 01:37.257
Then should we just leave them alone and ignore them?

01:37.281 --> 01:39.637
If we leave them like that, they'll all end up dead soon.

01:39.661 --> 01:41.348
Why should we care?

01:41.372 --> 01:43.387
Let's just grab what we need and get out.

01:43.411 --> 01:45.480
Yes, let's leave them here and get out.

01:45.702 --> 01:47.178
It's none of our business.

01:47.202 --> 01:49.098
Darn it! Come and open the doors, you punk!

01:49.122 --> 01:51.552
Shut it, you idiot!

01:51.831 --> 01:53.163
What should we do?

02:06.432 --> 02:07.807
Darn it.

02:19.321 --> 02:21.257
Hey, but...

02:21.281 --> 02:23.393
I thought something was weird since a while ago.

02:23.571 --> 02:27.433
You guys look really young. What are you doing with guns?

02:27.701 --> 02:29.137
And why do you look like such a mess?

02:29.161 --> 02:31.477
Right now, the outside world is at war.

02:31.501 --> 02:32.744
At war?

02:33.001 --> 02:34.289
There's a war going on?

02:34.342 --> 02:35.648
Hold on, then...

02:35.672 --> 02:37.277
Did North Korea invade us?

02:37.761 --> 02:40.148
See? What did I tell you? Darn it.

02:40.172 --> 02:41.857
I told you, didn't I?

02:41.881 --> 02:44.278
I said North Korea would invade us, didn't I?

02:44.302 --> 02:46.077
That's why they left us behind and ran off.

02:46.101 --> 02:48.908
Those darned prison guard jerks.

02:48.932 --> 02:51.038
Just wait until I get out of here. Those jerks.

02:51.062 --> 02:53.417
I'll kill those guys first. Darn it.

02:53.441 --> 02:56.104
I knew they'd be like this.

02:56.522 --> 02:58.590
Gosh, I feel much better now. Thank you.

02:59.612 --> 03:00.797
Kids.

03:00.821 --> 03:03.427
If you go around that corner, there's an office for the guards.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.507
There are a set of keys in there.

03:05.531 --> 03:07.324
Go and grab them for us.

03:10.501 --> 03:12.438
- We can't do that.
- What?

03:12.462 --> 03:14.938
What did you just say?

03:14.962 --> 03:16.655
You darned punks!

03:17.751 --> 03:19.126
Hey, kids.

03:19.672 --> 03:21.509
Stop joking around.

03:21.842 --> 03:23.737
Hurry up and grab the keys.

03:23.761 --> 03:26.408
The outside is even more dangerous right now.

03:26.432 --> 03:27.763
It's dangerous?

03:28.221 --> 03:30.246
What's it like out there?

03:30.772 --> 03:32.102
Well,

03:32.981 --> 03:35.687
do you really not know anything?

03:36.112 --> 03:37.343
Right now, there are...

03:40.531 --> 03:42.677
What is it? Why won't you finish what you're saying?

03:42.701 --> 03:45.257
- Why? What is it?
- What on earth is going on?

03:45.281 --> 03:47.856
Did the spheres in the sky fall down or something?

03:48.701 --> 03:51.364
What? Those purple balloon things?

03:52.251 --> 03:53.626
That makes sense.

03:55.082 --> 03:56.325
What's this?

03:57.251 --> 03:58.318
Is this for real?

03:58.342 --> 04:00.938
Darn it, this is driving me crazy! Just say it.

04:00.962 --> 04:02.987
No, you don't have to tell us.

04:03.011 --> 04:04.892
We don't really want to know anyway.

04:05.221 --> 04:07.908
Hey, just open these doors for us, quickly.

04:07.932 --> 04:10.494
Thanks for this. Now, open the doors.

04:15.522 --> 04:19.248
Kids, we were wrongfully convicted.

04:19.272 --> 04:21.427
All of us were framed by others.

04:21.612 --> 04:24.878
That's right. We haven't done anything wrong.

04:24.902 --> 04:27.258
Isn't that right? The prison guards didn't like us...

04:27.282 --> 04:28.756
Aren't you going to eat?

04:30.451 --> 04:31.969
Are you sick?

04:32.622 --> 04:33.848
You little punks.

04:33.872 --> 04:36.489
- Excuse me.
- You darned kids.

04:36.792 --> 04:38.035
Open the doors right now!

04:39.792 --> 04:41.107
Go get the keys!

04:41.131 --> 04:46.687
Gosh, that jerk. Why are you yelling at the kids?

04:47.932 --> 04:52.408
Please excuse him. It's because he's been locked up alone for so long.

04:52.432 --> 04:53.719
Hey.

04:54.232 --> 04:56.750
Kid. I'm sorry,

04:56.891 --> 04:58.641
but could I ask you for a favour?

05:00.312 --> 05:01.785
My mom...

05:03.032 --> 05:05.550
My mom doesn't know I'm in here.

05:07.242 --> 05:09.761
I should've sent her to a senior home,

05:09.992 --> 05:11.642
but I ruined everything.

05:13.951 --> 05:15.268
I just...

05:15.292 --> 05:19.328
want to know if my mom is doing okay.

05:19.961 --> 05:22.018
- Hey, you punk!
- Come on.

05:22.042 --> 05:25.121
Could you call...

05:25.261 --> 05:27.638
this number, please?

05:27.802 --> 05:29.132
Please do that for me.

05:30.722 --> 05:33.828
The last time I saw my mom,

05:33.852 --> 05:35.733
she couldn't eat very well.

05:36.352 --> 05:39.208
Since I'm not around, I'm worried...

05:39.232 --> 05:40.793
how she might be eating.

05:41.312 --> 05:43.547
But we can't really call people...

05:43.571 --> 05:45.221
Please, I'm begging you.

05:46.532 --> 05:50.927
Tell her that her son is living happily, so she shouldn't worry.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.848
There's no need to worry, and I'm really sorry.

05:53.872 --> 05:58.227
And tell her that I love her.

05:59.672 --> 06:01.277
Sorry for bothering you.

06:01.711 --> 06:03.187
I'm sorry.

06:03.211 --> 06:06.236
What are you doing? Go get them.

06:06.881 --> 06:09.487
Please, just open the doors!

06:09.511 --> 06:13.504
We'll go back as soon as we can and report on the situation here.

06:13.932 --> 06:16.908
Please hang in there a little longer until then.

06:16.932 --> 06:18.450
Darn it, open up!

06:18.732 --> 06:19.958
Open the doors, darn it!

06:19.982 --> 06:22.182
What a bunch of lies.

06:22.732 --> 06:24.107
Hey, are you kidding me?

06:24.441 --> 06:25.877
- Let's go.
- Hey, where are you going?

06:25.901 --> 06:27.797
- Don't go!
- Darn it!

06:27.821 --> 06:29.377
- We'll be back.
- Hey, stop.

06:29.401 --> 06:30.920
- Hey, don't go!
- Don't go.

06:33.622 --> 06:34.997
Hey, you kids.

06:35.662 --> 06:37.080
This is murder.

06:37.701 --> 06:40.737
Then you won't be any different from criminals like us.

06:48.091 --> 06:49.466
Darn it!

06:49.552 --> 06:50.839
- Ae Seol!
- Kids.

06:54.222 --> 06:56.190
- Hey, hurry up.
- Get over here.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.012
Get over here.

06:58.391 --> 06:59.708
You punks!

06:59.732 --> 07:02.247
Why is that murder? Darn it.

07:02.271 --> 07:04.933
Why did he have to say such a thing and make us feel gross?

07:06.071 --> 07:07.898
This is the right thing to do, isn't it?

07:10.532 --> 07:13.177
What would Mr. Lee have done in this situation?

07:13.201 --> 07:16.369
Mr. Lee would've done the same thing.

07:16.951 --> 07:18.218
Right.

07:18.242 --> 07:21.783
When the walkie-talkies are fixed, we can report this to them too.

07:21.872 --> 07:24.534
Darn it, this feels wrong.

07:25.422 --> 07:26.983
But...

07:27.461 --> 07:29.343
the guy in the last room...

07:29.841 --> 07:31.580
He seemed really sick.

07:31.922 --> 07:33.317
He couldn't even eat the food we gave him...

07:33.341 --> 07:35.960
Why are you getting all sentimental all of a sudden?

07:36.352 --> 07:38.578
I think we need to help him. He might...

07:38.602 --> 07:39.867
Hey, No Ae Seol.

07:39.891 --> 07:42.367
You seemed like you were coming to your senses. What's wrong now?

07:42.391 --> 07:44.966
We decided not to open the doors for them as a group.

07:47.771 --> 07:48.838
Then can we at least...

07:48.862 --> 07:51.292
Stop caring, you idiot.

07:53.362 --> 07:54.927
- I will...
- That's right, Ae Seol.

07:54.951 --> 07:57.240
We're also worried and feel bad about this,

07:57.451 --> 07:58.826
but for now,

07:59.242 --> 08:01.970
we should focus on the reason we came here in the first place.

08:03.412 --> 08:05.398
Let's look for the parts for the walkie-talkie now.

08:05.422 --> 08:07.984
And let's grab anything else we might need and get going.

08:08.042 --> 08:11.317
This is a prison, so there must be protective gear or weapons too.

08:11.341 --> 08:12.398
Right.

08:12.422 --> 08:14.357
As I said earlier, we just need to find the circuit board.

08:14.381 --> 08:16.317
- It's the thing that looks like...
- The thing that looks like a card.

08:16.341 --> 08:18.916
If we find it, we'll bring it to you or Young Sin.

08:19.052 --> 08:20.295
Are we good?

08:20.312 --> 08:21.328
Right.

08:21.352 --> 08:22.617
Let's spread out and look for it.

08:22.641 --> 08:24.016
Be careful, guys.

08:29.062 --> 08:30.392
Let's go.

09:19.912 --> 09:24.498
(Original Work: "Duty After School" from Naver Webtoon)

09:44.312 --> 09:48.788
(Duty After School)

09:48.812 --> 09:50.667
(Yongdu Service Area)

09:50.691 --> 09:52.385
This is strange.

09:53.772 --> 09:55.245
Gosh, seriously.

09:55.321 --> 09:57.258
Yes, that's it.

09:57.282 --> 10:00.508
We are girls who dream, let's go

10:00.532 --> 10:03.847
Can you feel me? Feel me

10:03.871 --> 10:07.402
Can you touch me? Hold onto me

10:08.042 --> 10:09.268
Hey.

10:09.292 --> 10:11.404
What are you doing there and not standing guard?

10:12.752 --> 10:14.437
You came down here too.

10:14.461 --> 10:15.817
I don't want to be alone.

10:15.841 --> 10:18.041
I had to go to the restroom.

10:18.471 --> 10:20.278
How many times are you going to the restroom?

10:20.302 --> 10:21.447
Aren't you just slacking off?

10:21.471 --> 10:22.618
I'm not.

10:22.642 --> 10:24.292
I just have sensitive bowels.

10:25.182 --> 10:27.800
Besides, you're the one who's slacking off.

10:28.022 --> 10:30.408
I let you get away with faking sick.

10:31.022 --> 10:33.816
I was really sick and had a fever earlier.

10:35.321 --> 10:36.597
Hey.

10:36.782 --> 10:38.289
Why are you both in here?

10:38.321 --> 10:41.388
Darn it. What if the spheres suddenly appear?

10:41.412 --> 10:43.138
They're not here.

10:43.162 --> 10:47.018
Besides, we didn't see any spheres, let alone a single cat until now.

10:47.042 --> 10:48.307
Don't go overboard.

10:48.331 --> 10:51.038
Why, you little... You told me to go and sleep.

10:51.042 --> 10:54.398
You're both slacking off. Darn it.

10:54.422 --> 10:56.728
She's right, we have the detector too.

10:56.752 --> 10:58.648
We don't have to be so strict about standing guard.

10:58.672 --> 10:59.778
It's cold outside.

10:59.802 --> 11:01.238
Let's get some rest.

11:01.262 --> 11:04.242
- Hey, you...
- It's finished!

11:04.512 --> 11:08.248
Ta-Da!

11:08.272 --> 11:09.591
How is it?

11:09.772 --> 11:11.102
It's so pretty.

11:11.142 --> 11:14.167
Jun Hee, how is it?

11:14.191 --> 11:16.998
You look like a darned beggar! Darn it.

11:17.022 --> 11:19.047
Why don't you even attach a flower to show how crazy you are?

11:19.071 --> 11:22.087
Come on. It looks totally like an idol singer's stage outfit.

11:22.111 --> 11:24.642
There you go again.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.740
Pick me up...

11:28.741 --> 11:32.478
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

11:32.502 --> 11:35.687
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - Pick me

11:35.711 --> 11:37.437
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

11:37.461 --> 11:39.211
- Pick me, pick me, pick me up - Hey.

11:39.632 --> 11:43.408
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

11:43.432 --> 11:46.413
Pick Ha Na

11:46.552 --> 11:49.763
All right, the honorary first-place winner...

11:49.851 --> 11:52.577
- is...
- Who is it?

11:52.601 --> 11:56.417
Trainee Yoo Ha Na!

11:56.441 --> 11:58.378
Thank you!

11:58.402 --> 12:00.417
- Thank you, - Yoo Ha Na.

12:00.441 --> 12:02.927
- Yoo Ha Na.
- Dear national producers.

12:02.951 --> 12:05.833
You've got to be kidding me.

12:12.412 --> 12:14.937
- What's wrong with her?
- It's because you called her lame.

12:14.961 --> 12:16.478
Me? What did I do?

12:16.502 --> 12:17.602
Goodness.

12:18.091 --> 12:21.248
I wanted to début before the age of 20.

12:31.471 --> 12:32.627
Guys.

12:33.312 --> 12:35.748
I think it's weird though.

12:35.772 --> 12:36.872
What?

12:37.691 --> 12:38.791
What is?

12:38.861 --> 12:40.963
- What is?
- I mean, the voting.

12:41.272 --> 12:44.583
A lot of those I asked threw negative votes.

12:45.321 --> 12:47.708
So why was the result always positive?

12:48.782 --> 12:51.905
Maybe they actually voted positive and lied to you...

12:52.331 --> 12:53.827
in case you would call them names.

12:54.002 --> 12:56.557
Hey, not everyone is hung up on extra points...

12:56.581 --> 12:58.287
like you and Young Soo.

12:59.632 --> 13:01.567
Extra points, my foot.

13:01.591 --> 13:02.608
A CSAT?

13:02.632 --> 13:05.197
Forget it. We don't even know how things will be next week.

13:05.221 --> 13:08.709
I saw you study in secret at night.

13:09.802 --> 13:12.947
- Me too.
- Right, Duk Joong?

13:12.971 --> 13:15.038
You're 100 percent right, Ha Na.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.327
Hey, you...

13:16.351 --> 13:17.788
So who's right?

13:17.812 --> 13:19.879
- Wait.
- Within...

13:20.361 --> 13:22.242
Guys, be quiet.

13:22.272 --> 13:23.758
You're 100 percent...

13:23.782 --> 13:25.758
- Darn, be quiet.
- Right.

13:25.782 --> 13:27.337
- What's wrong with you?
- What is it?

13:27.361 --> 13:28.638
Just follow me.

13:28.662 --> 13:29.894
What's this sound?

13:30.321 --> 13:31.758
- What is it?
- Do you hear it too?

13:31.782 --> 13:34.097
Guys... Gosh, the rifle.

13:34.121 --> 13:35.309
The rifle.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.728
- Hey.
- Why give this to me?

13:37.752 --> 13:39.228
Be quiet!

13:39.252 --> 13:40.439
Okay.

13:40.792 --> 13:41.946
One, two, three.

13:42.132 --> 13:45.108
- Take this.
- Goodness.

13:45.132 --> 13:48.025
- Darn it.
- Who are they?

13:48.721 --> 13:50.228
Maybe they're here for backup.

13:50.392 --> 13:52.658
- Let me...
- Just stay still.

13:52.682 --> 13:55.077
- Stay put.
- Why must we hide?

13:55.101 --> 13:57.577
- Be quiet.
- We have to ask them.

13:57.601 --> 14:01.457
Don't be a fool. We don't know what they're like.

14:01.481 --> 14:03.274
What if they try to harm us?

14:03.571 --> 14:05.758
- Oh, no.
- Darn you.

14:05.782 --> 14:09.217
Guys, stay put here while I go take a look.

14:09.241 --> 14:10.386
- Stay here.
- Okay.

14:12.871 --> 14:13.971
Darn it.

14:16.121 --> 14:18.437
- Guys.
- What is it?

14:18.461 --> 14:20.268
Quiet. They're right next to us.

14:20.292 --> 14:21.347
Stay still.

14:21.371 --> 14:23.187
- Is there anything?
- They took everything.

14:23.211 --> 14:24.898
- Go out!
- Go!

14:24.922 --> 14:26.065
Stay still.

14:27.552 --> 14:29.817
Guys, there's so much food here.

14:29.841 --> 14:30.908
- Gosh.
- Really?

14:30.932 --> 14:32.988
- No way.
- Let's go.

14:33.012 --> 14:34.827
- This is crazy.
- There's more here.

14:34.851 --> 14:35.908
- What on earth?
- No way!

14:35.932 --> 14:37.408
- Awesome.
- Goodness.

14:37.432 --> 14:39.707
That's my food!

14:39.731 --> 14:41.077
- Hey.
- My food!

14:41.101 --> 14:42.878
Please be quiet. They might hear us.

14:42.902 --> 14:44.684
But that's my food.

14:45.191 --> 14:46.380
Chi Yeol.

14:48.361 --> 14:49.692
What's on your mind?

14:50.652 --> 14:51.806
What?

14:53.412 --> 14:57.217
Well, it's nothing.

14:58.581 --> 15:02.024
There are no clean sheets.

15:02.621 --> 15:06.065
I know. We have to take some blankets too.

15:06.711 --> 15:09.099
Should I express my feelings now?

15:09.552 --> 15:11.708
Before Soo Chul makes a move first.

15:14.762 --> 15:15.960
What do I do?

15:20.932 --> 15:22.218
Look.

15:23.191 --> 15:26.810
I keep having anxious ideas these days.

15:28.532 --> 15:30.962
It's been just us for a month now.

15:31.441 --> 15:34.521
I wonder how things are in Seoul and other cities.

15:34.741 --> 15:36.369
Would it be similar to our situation?

15:37.162 --> 15:38.580
All communication is dead.

15:38.991 --> 15:41.334
It's been so long since we heard from our parents.

15:41.581 --> 15:43.649
I keep having bad imaginations.

15:44.672 --> 15:48.060
Will we be able...

15:49.591 --> 15:51.055
to go back to school?

15:53.182 --> 15:56.525
We're returning to school once this war ends.

15:56.971 --> 15:59.821
If we get to go back safely, will you go out with me?

16:03.981 --> 16:04.998
I'm sorry.

16:05.022 --> 16:08.628
Maybe I made you feel down too.

16:08.652 --> 16:10.763
We're all in the same situation after all.

16:11.991 --> 16:14.643
There isn't any here. Let's check upstairs.

16:17.412 --> 16:18.599
Na Ra.

16:19.662 --> 16:21.674
By any chance,

16:22.831 --> 16:24.481
last night...

16:25.002 --> 16:26.102
What?

16:29.711 --> 16:30.811
Last night...

16:35.721 --> 16:36.910
Did you sleep well?

16:41.012 --> 16:43.577
I mean... At a time like this,

16:43.601 --> 16:46.264
you need to sleep and eat properly to keep yourself healthy.

16:46.652 --> 16:48.577
Health comes first, you know.

16:49.652 --> 16:50.752
Right.

16:51.821 --> 16:55.814
I couldn't sleep, but I'm all right.

16:59.162 --> 17:00.394
Now is the time.

17:02.412 --> 17:07.098
Kim Chi Yeol, tell her how you feel. Tell her, you idiot.

17:07.121 --> 17:09.102
- Chi Yeol.
- Yes?

17:10.252 --> 17:11.352
Thanks...

17:12.382 --> 17:13.570
for looking out for me.

17:17.512 --> 17:20.537
Don't mention it. This is only natural.

17:21.812 --> 17:22.955
We're friends.

17:25.601 --> 17:27.758
Right. Let's go out.

17:31.522 --> 17:32.676
You idiot.

17:34.282 --> 17:38.132
(Yongwon Metropolitan Hospital)

17:41.911 --> 17:43.792
I wanted to go to med school too.

17:45.792 --> 17:49.135
My mom was sick since I was little.

17:49.871 --> 17:52.728
But my grades weren't high enough...

17:52.752 --> 17:54.633
that I decided to go to nursing school.

17:56.302 --> 17:59.558
I might barely get accepted to nursing school though.

18:03.181 --> 18:06.856
When I was a junior, my first choice was med school too.

18:08.062 --> 18:11.288
Apply for it. Your grades are high enough, no?

18:11.312 --> 18:12.510
Well...

18:13.901 --> 18:16.245
The tuition costs too much.

18:16.282 --> 18:17.888
And it takes too long to graduate.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.408
I think it's better to just go to a regular college...

18:23.032 --> 18:26.661
that offers a scholarship and take a civil-service exam later.

18:26.952 --> 18:28.938
You should have a bigger picture in mind.

18:28.962 --> 18:31.382
You know if you become a doctor, you'll earn much more.

18:34.792 --> 18:39.115
My family isn't well-off enough to wait for me until then.

18:39.921 --> 18:41.627
And I have to get a job soon...

18:42.141 --> 18:43.968
for my siblings' college education.

18:44.472 --> 18:45.616
I see.

18:49.732 --> 18:51.195
This is unexpected of you.

18:51.692 --> 18:53.199
Sorry?

18:54.062 --> 18:55.305
What is?

18:55.821 --> 18:57.240
I'm proud of you.

18:58.111 --> 19:00.125
Your parents must be.

19:02.861 --> 19:04.149
Not really.

19:04.621 --> 19:07.057
Guys! The dispensary is this way.

19:07.081 --> 19:08.919
- Come quick.
- Okay.

19:09.581 --> 19:11.506
- Let's go.
- Okay.

19:12.042 --> 19:14.357
My gosh, there's so much useful medicine here.

19:14.381 --> 19:15.570
Look.

19:15.671 --> 19:18.607
I'm so annoyed to think how many trips we made...

19:18.631 --> 19:19.938
to pharmacies just for nothing.

19:19.962 --> 19:22.528
We need to take antibiotics and anticoagulants.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.317
- Okay.
- We can treat frostbite with those.

19:24.341 --> 19:25.452
Really?

19:25.512 --> 19:27.437
Jun Hee will be delighted.

19:28.101 --> 19:29.907
Oh, we should take cold medicine...

19:29.931 --> 19:31.657
and anti fungal drugs for athlete's foot too.

19:31.681 --> 19:32.748
Got it.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.087
Never mind. Let's just take everything here.

19:35.111 --> 19:36.255
Sure thing.

19:37.861 --> 19:39.005
Oh, right.

19:39.901 --> 19:42.476
So Yeon, wait. Let me carry that.

19:42.742 --> 19:44.468
Young Soo. This too, please.

19:44.492 --> 19:45.636
That too?

19:46.071 --> 19:47.847
Young Soo, wait. This too.

19:47.871 --> 19:49.335
This is...

19:51.752 --> 19:53.728
- Goodness.
- Hey!

19:53.752 --> 19:56.314
- Young Soo!
- Oh, dear.

19:56.381 --> 19:57.845
(Rooms 301 to 312)

19:58.131 --> 19:59.275
What's wrong with you?

20:00.212 --> 20:02.048
Come on, Kim Chi Yeol.

20:03.591 --> 20:06.341
Why regret now after not being able to say a word?

20:06.391 --> 20:09.185
That was a perfect moment...

20:12.891 --> 20:15.091
No way!

20:16.861 --> 20:18.919
Goodness.

20:22.532 --> 20:24.732
I haven't had a chocolate bar in such a long time.

20:25.242 --> 20:26.573
Thanks for the food.

20:37.252 --> 20:38.627
This is crazy.

20:41.212 --> 20:43.004
This is the one! Nice.

20:43.052 --> 20:45.407
There. I found it.

20:45.431 --> 20:46.657
There are more than a few.

20:46.681 --> 20:48.331
It's worth a month at least.

20:50.762 --> 20:52.323
Please...

20:56.101 --> 20:58.301
Yes!

21:02.482 --> 21:03.680
Thank goodness.

21:35.641 --> 21:37.435
If...

21:41.111 --> 21:45.236
by any chance, I end up dying,

21:45.321 --> 21:47.840
I won't be able to confess at all, so I'm leaving this.

21:51.992 --> 21:53.092
Na Ra.

21:53.792 --> 21:55.893
From the moment I saw you for the first time,

21:57.252 --> 21:58.352
I have liked...

22:04.252 --> 22:05.450
This is not it.

22:08.802 --> 22:11.233
When we go back to school, will you go out...

22:11.722 --> 22:14.064
Will you go out...

22:14.262 --> 22:18.023
I just like... Let's go...

22:19.192 --> 22:22.217
Darn my stupid mouth.

22:26.571 --> 22:27.859
Soo Chul...

22:28.992 --> 22:30.323
was brave.

22:32.532 --> 22:34.369
It's nerve-racking to do it alone,

22:35.371 --> 22:36.835
and he did it in front of Na Ra.

22:39.212 --> 22:40.950
You're good. I will give you that.

22:42.881 --> 22:45.312
What do you suggest we do? Should we just go back?

22:45.552 --> 22:47.752
Are you suggesting that we just quit it like this?

23:11.992 --> 23:13.620
You want to tell them everything now?

23:14.121 --> 23:16.365
You think the kids will just understand it then?

23:26.002 --> 23:27.333
Gosh.

23:31.171 --> 23:33.746
Is anyone there?

23:49.361 --> 23:50.692
What is it?

23:50.782 --> 23:52.013
I thought...

23:52.361 --> 23:54.242
I heard something.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.432
- Were you with someone?
- No.

23:57.581 --> 23:58.858
I was alone.

24:01.452 --> 24:02.838
Right.

24:03.161 --> 24:04.492
I see.

24:05.331 --> 24:07.817
What is it? What did you hear?

24:08.002 --> 24:09.333
It's...

24:14.181 --> 24:15.556
It's nothing.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.460
I must have heard it wrong.

24:21.351 --> 24:22.639
Why aren't you asking me?

24:23.062 --> 24:24.524
About what happened yesterday?

24:28.022 --> 24:29.451
Yesterday. Right.

24:30.732 --> 24:32.524
What happened?

24:36.161 --> 24:37.387
Na Ra said yes.

24:37.411 --> 24:38.786
We are together.

24:43.081 --> 24:44.544
I'm joking.

24:45.502 --> 24:47.613
- Right.
- I told her to take her time.

24:48.131 --> 24:49.506
But...

24:50.042 --> 24:51.978
even if she turns me down, I won't give up.

24:52.591 --> 24:54.660
I will keep asking her out...

24:55.091 --> 24:56.610
until she accepts me.

24:59.762 --> 25:02.379
Right.

25:04.062 --> 25:05.349
What's wrong?

25:06.692 --> 25:08.208
Are you nervous because you have a rival now?

25:08.232 --> 25:10.618
What are you talking about?

25:13.742 --> 25:15.248
You like Na Ra too.

25:19.871 --> 25:21.521
How did you know...

25:23.081 --> 25:24.819
You stare at her every day.

25:26.542 --> 25:27.917
Am I wrong?

25:30.591 --> 25:32.018
Where are you guys?

25:32.042 --> 25:34.253
- Chi Yeol!
- Guys!

25:34.302 --> 25:36.589
- Kim Chi Yeol!
- They are calling for us.

25:36.841 --> 25:38.085
Let's go.

25:57.321 --> 25:59.753
(Yongwon Penitentiary)

27:01.262 --> 27:02.724
Hey, Mister.

27:17.782 --> 27:19.608
Are you really unwell, Mister?

27:24.282 --> 27:25.524
Mister.

27:35.292 --> 27:36.721
You witch!

27:41.671 --> 27:43.448
I can't find cigarettes anywhere.

27:43.472 --> 27:46.198
I guess people make sure to take cigarettes with them.

27:46.222 --> 27:48.147
I know.

27:51.391 --> 27:52.708
Did you hear that?

27:52.732 --> 27:53.963
What?

27:56.361 --> 27:57.918
- Where's No Ae Seol?
- What?

27:57.942 --> 27:59.337
Where is No Ae Seol?

27:59.361 --> 28:00.736
Wasn't she with you?

28:01.032 --> 28:02.538
Darn it.

28:05.202 --> 28:06.887
Why wouldn't you open the door?

28:06.911 --> 28:08.968
Why won't you listen to me, you witch!

28:08.992 --> 28:11.378
Why would you make me the bad guy, you wicked witch!

28:15.331 --> 28:18.038
I thought I was going to die in here.

28:20.302 --> 28:21.445
Gosh.

28:22.302 --> 28:23.633
My darling.

28:26.512 --> 28:27.798
Thank you.

28:53.502 --> 28:54.877
What is he saying?

28:55.161 --> 28:56.911
- I don't know.
- Gosh.

28:57.831 --> 28:59.688
- What are you doing? Come on.
- You go.

28:59.712 --> 29:01.107
- Darn it.
- Come. You have to do this.

29:01.131 --> 29:02.857
You go first.

29:02.881 --> 29:04.256
Never mind.

29:06.222 --> 29:07.552
Gosh.

29:08.262 --> 29:09.593
Darn it.

29:10.891 --> 29:13.554
Development plan. Search status.

29:14.272 --> 29:16.516
Look at these.

29:16.851 --> 29:18.458
They are actually pretty systematic.

29:18.601 --> 29:21.377
It looks like they are on their own without a commander-in-chief.

29:21.401 --> 29:22.458
Right.

29:22.482 --> 29:23.837
Are they naive or stupid?

29:23.861 --> 29:25.655
They must've had a vote.

29:25.702 --> 29:28.583
They've stocked up quite a lot of food too.

29:28.952 --> 29:30.602
Look, guys.

29:30.661 --> 29:33.005
They've saved up a lot of bullets.

29:33.411 --> 29:35.228
- How many have they got?
- Over 800.

29:35.252 --> 29:37.057
Let's ask them if we can borrow some.

29:37.081 --> 29:38.347
No. I'm shy.

29:38.371 --> 29:40.351
I will ask them.

29:40.881 --> 29:42.147
- You're the best.
- Look.

29:42.171 --> 29:43.728
There are lots of girls.

29:43.752 --> 29:45.544
- Girls?
- Girls? Let me see.

29:46.421 --> 29:47.857
- Look.
- How many are they?

29:47.881 --> 29:49.278
One, two, three, four,

29:49.302 --> 29:51.281
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

29:51.351 --> 29:53.001
- Ten girls!
- Hey.

29:53.512 --> 29:54.948
- Are you happy?
- We are happy.

29:54.972 --> 29:56.302
I am not happy.

29:56.391 --> 29:58.168
I hope they are...

29:58.192 --> 30:00.748
the feminine type, unlike you girls.

30:00.772 --> 30:02.168
- Right?
- Right.

30:02.192 --> 30:04.627
Female sex chromosome wouldn't be their only female attribute.

30:04.651 --> 30:06.337
- Are you crazy?
- Think about how you look.

30:06.361 --> 30:07.928
- Hey.
- Gosh.

30:07.952 --> 30:09.415
I will actually shoot you.

30:09.452 --> 30:11.508
Just shoot him.

30:11.702 --> 30:12.890
Do not hesitate.

30:14.042 --> 30:15.504
Hands up!

30:16.452 --> 30:17.651
Hands up!

30:17.752 --> 30:18.768
You. Move.

30:18.792 --> 30:20.438
- Okay.
- Move.

30:20.462 --> 30:22.706
- Hands up.
- Hurry up!

30:24.462 --> 30:25.748
Science high school?

30:26.512 --> 30:29.407
Gosh, they are high school seniors too. We didn't have to get scared.

30:29.431 --> 30:30.939
Don't get intimidated.

30:31.841 --> 30:33.590
Science high school.

30:33.681 --> 30:37.950
- So you study science?
- Yes.

30:38.601 --> 30:40.714
What's wrong with her?

30:42.351 --> 30:43.377
Yes.

30:43.401 --> 30:45.140
We go to science high school.

30:52.282 --> 30:55.968
You don't look nerdy, so we nearly got you wrong.

30:55.992 --> 30:57.740
This?

30:57.871 --> 30:59.518
We normally don't get to do this,

30:59.542 --> 31:01.742
so I thought I would do it now.

31:02.631 --> 31:03.688
And you know,

31:03.712 --> 31:06.440
and it's a prejudice that a smart kid has to look like a nerd.

31:06.921 --> 31:08.817
It's my first time to meet students from the science high school.

31:08.841 --> 31:11.460
You guys must be really smart.

31:13.722 --> 31:15.735
Well, we are not too bad.

31:16.431 --> 31:18.676
But you are the worst among us.

31:19.391 --> 31:21.538
So what? There are three people after me.

31:21.562 --> 31:24.455
So what? You're not any better than them.

31:25.022 --> 31:26.770
Whatever you say.

31:28.821 --> 31:30.109
By the way, why are you here?

31:30.692 --> 31:34.464
We were passing by, and it looked occupied.

31:35.871 --> 31:39.029
By the way, there are just the three of you?

31:39.202 --> 31:41.768
No. Other kids went out on a mission.

31:41.792 --> 31:43.904
We are guarding the base camp.

31:45.631 --> 31:46.908
Darn it.

31:47.881 --> 31:49.028
Hey, we don't know if they are an ally or foe.

31:49.052 --> 31:52.077
Why would you give away our Intel?

31:52.262 --> 31:53.802
They are not the spheres, are they?

31:53.841 --> 31:55.317
How can they be the foe?

31:55.341 --> 31:57.179
We don't know who they are.

31:57.891 --> 31:59.960
And what is up with your tone?

32:00.272 --> 32:01.778
What's wrong with my tone?

32:02.851 --> 32:04.556
You sound too cute.

32:04.851 --> 32:07.106
I always sound cute.

32:08.821 --> 32:10.746
And why do you care how I sound?

32:11.492 --> 32:12.508
I am just worried.

32:12.532 --> 32:13.627
Who asked you to worry?

32:13.651 --> 32:15.907
My heart wants to worry. My heart.

32:18.581 --> 32:20.825
You two are going out, aren't you?

32:22.161 --> 32:23.518
- Is it obvious?
- It's obvious.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.609
It's obvious?

32:29.421 --> 32:31.116
Just ignore them.

32:31.552 --> 32:34.345
So where are you headed?

32:34.591 --> 32:36.488
- Seoul.
- Seoul?

32:36.512 --> 32:38.437
Yes. We are going to the shelter in Seoul.

32:38.512 --> 32:39.843
Do you want to join us?

32:40.472 --> 32:41.902
Seoul?

32:42.062 --> 32:43.208
On your own?

32:43.232 --> 32:45.918
Sounds good. Let's go together then.

32:45.942 --> 32:48.248
- That sounds good.
- I love it.

32:48.272 --> 32:50.428
- I love it too.
- No.

32:50.692 --> 32:52.342
We have to stay here.

32:52.611 --> 32:54.680
We have to wait for the others.

32:54.742 --> 32:56.178
- Right.
- Right.

32:56.202 --> 32:57.678
We were like that first,

32:57.702 --> 32:59.678
but we decided to go separate ways this time.

32:59.702 --> 33:01.032
What?

33:01.202 --> 33:02.887
What about the others then?

33:02.911 --> 33:05.199
They are staying behind, carrying out the operation.

33:05.621 --> 33:07.438
CSAT is cancelled though.

33:07.462 --> 33:09.431
What's wrong with them?

33:09.542 --> 33:10.971
I know.

33:11.881 --> 33:13.487
What did you just say?

33:13.841 --> 33:15.907
I don't know what's wrong with them.

33:15.931 --> 33:18.220
No. Before that.

33:19.012 --> 33:20.662
CSAT got cancelled?

33:20.931 --> 33:22.351
Is that true?

33:22.562 --> 33:23.793
Yes.

33:26.062 --> 33:27.437
You...

33:27.982 --> 33:29.213
didn't know?

33:29.482 --> 33:32.551
Wait. CSAT really got cancelled?

33:32.901 --> 33:34.507
How did you guys find out?

33:34.821 --> 33:38.220
They radioed each unit and let us know.

33:40.242 --> 33:41.715
Didn't you guys hear about it?

33:42.702 --> 33:46.557
No. Our walkie-talkie is broken.

33:46.581 --> 33:49.647
Gosh, then were you here carrying out the operation...

33:49.671 --> 33:51.454
when your walkie-talkie is broken?

33:51.962 --> 33:54.488
Gosh, it must've been hard for you.

33:54.512 --> 33:57.107
- Hey, tell us in detail.
- What?

33:57.131 --> 33:58.657
Are you sure the CSAT is cancelled?

33:58.681 --> 34:00.028
Then is everyone supposed to go home?

34:00.052 --> 34:01.867
Are we being discharged? What did they say?

34:01.891 --> 34:03.617
We're not being discharged.

34:03.641 --> 34:05.038
The CSAT has been cancelled,

34:05.062 --> 34:06.998
but they'll give us extra points for next year's exams.

34:07.022 --> 34:08.708
They said to continue with the operation as planned.

34:08.732 --> 34:12.120
That's right. But we had different opinions.

34:12.151 --> 34:14.495
We can't really believe what they tell us.

34:14.821 --> 34:17.704
And as you can see, we're really exhausted. That's why.

34:17.951 --> 34:20.151
So you guys were the only ones who got the news.

34:20.491 --> 34:24.927
Well, I'm sure the other schools got the news too.

34:24.951 --> 34:27.107
Then we should go back to Seoul too.

34:27.252 --> 34:29.648
Why should we stay here if the CSAT has been cancelled?

34:29.672 --> 34:30.648
When the others get back,

34:30.672 --> 34:32.497
- let's tell them to go home.
- Right.

34:32.581 --> 34:35.068
- Jun Hee. Let's go home.
- Did you really get the radio?

34:35.092 --> 34:36.358
I want to hear it myself.

34:36.382 --> 34:39.318
Could you maybe tell them news about our unit too?

34:39.342 --> 34:42.971
But our walkie-talkie is with the others who stayed behind.

34:43.221 --> 34:45.014
- Gosh, darn it.
- Darn it.

34:46.181 --> 34:48.337
Do you want me to fix your walkie-talkie for you?

34:48.851 --> 34:51.514
What? Can you fix it?

34:52.902 --> 34:54.046
No.

34:54.982 --> 34:57.668
Not me, but him. I'm sure he can fix it.

34:57.692 --> 34:59.760
He even entered a science competition and won.

35:02.572 --> 35:05.695
Really? Can you really fix it?

35:08.042 --> 35:09.185
I'm not sure.

35:10.121 --> 35:11.684
I'll have to see it first.

35:14.502 --> 35:17.318
- Oh, so that's what it looks like.
- That's cool.

35:17.342 --> 35:19.527
So you can get calls but can't get radio messages, right?

35:19.551 --> 35:20.696
Yes.

35:26.812 --> 35:29.099
- What?
- Why?

35:29.101 --> 35:32.270
- I don't think this can be fixed.
- What?

35:32.312 --> 35:35.668
Gosh, you were so confident before. My goodness.

35:35.692 --> 35:39.128
No. This is a PRC-999K model.

35:39.152 --> 35:42.467
From where you're standing, if you look at the bottom left,

35:42.491 --> 35:44.007
there's a thing called a circuit board card.

35:44.031 --> 35:46.374
That's this thing right here.

35:46.531 --> 35:48.093
Explain it in easy terms.

35:48.951 --> 35:50.107
Look here.

35:50.161 --> 35:52.137
This rectangular thing is the frequency modulator.

35:52.161 --> 35:53.361
But...

35:55.172 --> 35:56.358
it's missing these two parts.

35:56.382 --> 35:57.777
- Really?
- No way.

35:57.801 --> 35:58.990
You're right.

35:59.422 --> 36:00.777
- What's he saying?
- No way.

36:00.801 --> 36:02.517
I told you to explain it in easy terms.

36:02.672 --> 36:04.278
My goodness.

36:04.551 --> 36:06.344
This part is gone.

36:06.681 --> 36:09.197
So, you're saying we can't get radio messages...

36:09.221 --> 36:11.246
because we don't have this part, right?

36:12.181 --> 36:14.418
Did it bump into something and get knocked out?

36:14.442 --> 36:15.586
Is that what happened?

36:15.982 --> 36:20.019
This can't be removed unless somebody takes it out on purpose.

36:22.072 --> 36:23.216
On purpose?

36:23.741 --> 36:26.887
He's saying it's not broken.

36:26.911 --> 36:28.924
Someone took it out on purpose.

36:30.871 --> 36:32.334
Someone did it on purpose?

36:32.962 --> 36:34.150
Why?

36:47.592 --> 36:50.034
(Hopeful Corrections)

37:00.572 --> 37:01.628
What is it?

37:01.652 --> 37:03.621
Who shot that? Was it a sphere?

37:06.072 --> 37:07.952
Gosh, what do we do?

37:08.031 --> 37:09.176
Idiot.

37:09.371 --> 37:10.717
Hey, Yeon Bo Ra. Where are you going?

37:10.741 --> 37:11.897
Hurry up!

37:13.661 --> 37:14.761
Darn it.

37:15.371 --> 37:16.890
- Hey, wait up!
- Darn it.

37:18.252 --> 37:20.728
Gosh, it was a real gun.

37:20.752 --> 37:22.648
You scared me, you jerk.

37:22.672 --> 37:24.318
Gosh, it was real.

37:24.342 --> 37:25.648
Darn it.

37:25.672 --> 37:27.697
Hey, scrawny man, nice job.

37:27.721 --> 37:29.117
Gosh, how scary.

37:29.141 --> 37:31.660
- Am I cool?
- Yes, you are.

37:33.851 --> 37:37.889
Oh, I borrowed your mom's photo for a little while.

37:38.062 --> 37:39.382
We made it out thanks to that.

37:39.522 --> 37:41.088
You used it like that?

37:41.112 --> 37:42.918
- Unbelievable.
- I got goosebumps.

37:42.942 --> 37:45.240
Brother, I salute you.

37:46.241 --> 37:48.210
Thank you very much.

37:50.322 --> 37:51.476
What...

37:52.911 --> 37:56.228
Hey, it would've been nice if you opened it sooner.

37:56.252 --> 37:58.761
Did you really have to make us show you our true colours?

37:59.081 --> 38:01.318
Still, it's a good thing that she's naive.

38:01.342 --> 38:03.478
We almost died in here.

38:03.502 --> 38:04.568
- I know.
- Right.

38:04.592 --> 38:07.067
Hey, look how soft her skin is.

38:07.382 --> 38:09.307
- You're right.
- Let me touch it too.

38:09.431 --> 38:10.663
Stop that.

38:12.051 --> 38:14.867
Don't quiver. It's making me want you more.

38:14.891 --> 38:16.310
What? Really?

38:16.851 --> 38:21.032
All right, cutie. What's going on out there right now?

38:22.062 --> 38:25.328
Hey, stop wasting time and let's get going.

38:27.991 --> 38:32.097
Mister, there's no need to rush so much.

38:32.121 --> 38:34.090
What if the whole military is out there?

38:34.121 --> 38:36.597
We should find out what's going on out there first.

38:36.621 --> 38:40.557
You might have been the boss in the outside world,

38:40.581 --> 38:43.068
but in here, you have to listen to us.

38:43.092 --> 38:44.148
Bang.

38:44.172 --> 38:46.009
Hey, you're a good shot.

38:46.962 --> 38:48.897
All right, now tell me.

38:48.971 --> 38:50.709
What are you guys hiding?

38:54.931 --> 38:56.119
Aren't you going to talk?

39:07.322 --> 39:08.883
Please let me go.

39:10.031 --> 39:11.967
Darn it, you really won't listen!

39:11.991 --> 39:14.378
- Hey, give me that.
- Okay.

39:15.371 --> 39:19.309
Kids! Your friend is with us.

39:19.871 --> 39:21.478
Let's have a meeting!

39:21.502 --> 39:23.307
Let's talk!

39:23.331 --> 39:24.894
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

39:30.721 --> 39:31.909
Darn it!

39:36.681 --> 39:38.367
(Yongwon Metropolitan Hospital)

39:38.391 --> 39:39.954
- Gosh.
- There are so many.

39:40.641 --> 39:43.128
Hey, they have regular ammo,

39:43.152 --> 39:46.248
and they have more than two boxes of these.

39:46.272 --> 39:48.458
- Really?
- Gosh.

39:48.482 --> 39:50.757
But was this truck trying to get patients out?

39:50.781 --> 39:52.156
Why did they leave it here?

39:52.652 --> 39:54.489
Were they attacked by spheres?

39:55.121 --> 39:57.827
Who cares? We have a whole lot of ammo now.

39:58.792 --> 40:01.442
Is today some kind of special day? Is it our birthday today?

40:01.831 --> 40:04.398
If the others find out, they'll be so happy, right?

40:04.422 --> 40:06.578
What? Yes, right.

40:06.962 --> 40:10.812
Hey, we found the medicine. This is so great.

40:10.922 --> 40:13.987
Yeon Ju, why are you crying?

40:14.011 --> 40:15.661
You should smile.

40:16.551 --> 40:20.248
Goodness, someone might think you found a river of gold.

40:20.272 --> 40:21.708
Let's grab everything and get back.

40:21.732 --> 40:24.077
I want to see the others become happy too.

40:24.101 --> 40:26.498
- Then I'll load up the ammo.
- And I'll help.

40:26.522 --> 40:29.338
Then the rest of us should go upstairs and grab what we need.

40:29.362 --> 40:31.717
We can get stuff like medicine, blankets, and anything else we need.

40:31.741 --> 40:34.030
Okay, then we'll go get the water tanks.

40:34.911 --> 40:36.298
Twenty minutes should do it, right?

40:36.322 --> 40:38.757
- Then let's meet back here.
- Okay.

40:38.781 --> 40:40.618
- All right.
- Okay!

40:41.331 --> 40:43.025
The others will be so surprised.

40:44.922 --> 40:47.847
Hey, but where is Soo Chul?

40:48.672 --> 40:49.816
What?

40:51.382 --> 40:52.966
Did he go to the restroom for a bit?

40:53.471 --> 40:56.452
Is that so? Then you get Soo Chul and grab the blankets.

40:56.801 --> 40:58.044
Why should I?

40:58.721 --> 41:01.288
Just do what you're told. Why do you ask so many questions?

41:01.312 --> 41:02.730
Everyone else is helping out.

41:03.732 --> 41:07.032
Hey, I'll just go.

41:07.601 --> 41:09.351
Darn it. That would've been nice.

41:13.991 --> 41:15.641
Then I'll see you later.

41:20.661 --> 41:22.730
Who does he think he is to order me around?

41:28.792 --> 41:31.091
Do your ears hurt?

41:37.051 --> 41:39.117
Gosh, you guys got here so fast.

41:39.141 --> 41:41.198
Oh, gosh. Your friends are here.

41:41.351 --> 41:42.451
Jang Soo.

41:45.562 --> 41:46.748
What are they doing?

41:46.772 --> 41:49.168
What are you doing? Darn it! You punks!

41:49.192 --> 41:50.708
What do you think you're doing?

41:50.732 --> 41:51.998
Hey, you punk!

41:52.022 --> 41:54.728
- Hey, jerks. Can't you see?
- You darned punks!

41:54.862 --> 41:56.929
Come with us.

41:57.031 --> 41:59.338
Your friends are here. Say hi.

41:59.362 --> 42:01.298
Can't you see what's going on, you little punks?

42:01.322 --> 42:03.637
- Let her go first.
- Open this door first, punk.

42:03.661 --> 42:05.268
I'll open it if you let her go!

42:05.292 --> 42:06.268
Darn it.

42:06.292 --> 42:07.978
Hey, open up first. If not,

42:08.002 --> 42:11.577
your friend will die. Got it?

42:11.962 --> 42:13.524
She really will die.

42:14.502 --> 42:15.612
Got it?

42:18.551 --> 42:19.651
Okay?

42:22.011 --> 42:24.310
Darn it, here we go again.

42:25.101 --> 42:26.245
Hey, get on your knees.

42:28.101 --> 42:29.895
Darn it!

42:30.402 --> 42:32.788
Your friend is dying because of you guys.

42:32.812 --> 42:35.430
Do you not care?

42:41.112 --> 42:42.673
She really will die.

42:47.161 --> 42:48.492
She's not our friend.

42:52.382 --> 42:54.818
You nasty wench. Hang on. What are you doing?

42:54.842 --> 42:57.174
- You guys, aim your guns too.
- Bo Ra.

42:57.342 --> 42:59.608
We have seven guns. And they only have one.

42:59.632 --> 43:01.568
Don't you see Ae Seol is being held hostage?

43:08.562 --> 43:10.080
Darn it, what are they doing?

43:22.411 --> 43:23.555
Hey.

43:24.371 --> 43:25.597
Do you want to see your friend die?

43:25.621 --> 43:27.227
I told you, she's not our friend.

43:27.411 --> 43:29.427
She acted however she wanted and got everyone in danger.

43:29.451 --> 43:30.607
She's no friend of ours.

43:31.712 --> 43:33.268
Yeon Bo Ra. Just calm down for now.

43:33.292 --> 43:34.535
Bo Ra is right.

43:34.922 --> 43:37.342
There's no need to give in to these criminals' demands.

43:38.051 --> 43:40.277
Darn it, we're screwed. They have so many guns.

43:40.301 --> 43:42.094
No, they're bluffing.

43:42.382 --> 43:45.197
- Can't you see his hands trembling?
- Darn it.

43:45.221 --> 43:47.564
- Gosh.
- Oh, man.

43:50.101 --> 43:52.827
Hey! You darned punks! Open up!

43:52.851 --> 43:55.498
I have to get out of here... Darn it.

43:55.522 --> 43:56.677
Gosh.

43:59.402 --> 44:01.378
If you just open these doors, no one gets hurt and it'll all be over.

44:01.402 --> 44:03.150
Let Ae Seol go first.

44:19.551 --> 44:20.651
Just go.

44:24.891 --> 44:28.741
And I'm really sorry for causing this situation.

44:45.161 --> 44:47.592
Shut your mouth, you wench.

44:47.911 --> 44:50.137
You darn stupid idiot.

44:50.161 --> 44:53.461
Why do you have to act up?

44:53.542 --> 44:55.279
You filthy moron.

44:55.542 --> 44:56.807
Darn it!

44:56.831 --> 44:58.988
Look at you, idiot.

44:59.382 --> 45:00.614
Kids.

45:00.632 --> 45:03.195
I'm sorry.

45:04.971 --> 45:06.346
That must hurt.

45:06.641 --> 45:07.907
It must be painful.

45:07.931 --> 45:09.218
Get up. It's all right.

45:12.812 --> 45:13.867
No!

45:13.891 --> 45:15.248
- You little...
- Hey!

45:15.272 --> 45:17.065
- Get up.
- What are you doing? Stop!

45:17.601 --> 45:18.998
It's been darn hard for me to hold it in.

45:19.022 --> 45:20.338
Please stop!

45:20.362 --> 45:22.287
Kids, it's time for sex education.

45:22.402 --> 45:24.514
We'll teach you how babies are made.

45:24.822 --> 45:26.217
Stop, darn it!

45:26.241 --> 45:28.299
Stop.

45:28.531 --> 45:31.006
- Stop!
- What are you looking at?

45:32.581 --> 45:33.956
I said, stop!

45:34.701 --> 45:36.638
Darn it! Get your hands off her!

45:49.551 --> 45:51.344
Darn.

45:51.471 --> 45:53.396
Goodness.

45:53.601 --> 45:56.120
Should I go first?

45:57.062 --> 45:58.437
Never mind.

45:58.522 --> 46:00.821
Kids, I will give you...

46:00.902 --> 46:02.464
just 10 minutes.

46:02.772 --> 46:04.208
If you're even a second late,

46:04.232 --> 46:07.311
I won't be able to stop these guys.

46:09.322 --> 46:10.697
Gosh, a scent of woman.

46:17.252 --> 46:19.264
Do you understand, Bo Ra?

46:23.632 --> 46:25.149
Okay.

46:36.312 --> 46:37.543
Goodness.

46:44.522 --> 46:45.809
Let's just release them.

46:46.741 --> 46:48.007
There's no other way.

46:48.031 --> 46:49.217
Then what?

46:49.241 --> 46:52.409
Do you think they will let Ae Seol go that easily?

46:53.781 --> 46:55.662
All of us will be in danger.

46:56.121 --> 46:59.228
Then what do we do?

46:59.252 --> 47:02.914
Darn it! Those despicable scums.

47:10.301 --> 47:11.907
What is it?

47:12.301 --> 47:13.407
Spheres?

47:13.431 --> 47:14.927
Where did they suddenly come from?

47:16.851 --> 47:18.039
There are four.

47:18.221 --> 47:19.327
They're approaching near.

47:19.351 --> 47:20.577
What do we do?

47:20.601 --> 47:23.176
Why even the spheres now?

47:26.022 --> 47:28.782
Given this speed, they'll enter the building in a few minutes.

47:29.241 --> 47:30.572
It can't be helped.

47:31.862 --> 47:33.193
Let's release them.

47:33.741 --> 47:34.930
Gosh.

47:35.281 --> 47:38.449
What if they just ran off?

47:38.542 --> 47:41.478
Maybe we're doomed for being all laid back.

47:41.502 --> 47:43.152
Whether it's war or anything,

47:43.331 --> 47:46.358
something definitely happened outside.

47:46.382 --> 47:49.770
In that case, going outside unprepared...

47:50.011 --> 47:52.197
could be more dangerous.

47:52.221 --> 47:53.407
Hey.

47:53.431 --> 47:55.777
Is it really true that the spheres or whatever fell from the sky...

47:55.801 --> 47:57.319
and caused a disaster outside?

47:57.351 --> 47:59.639
Be honest with me. Where did you come from?

48:00.022 --> 48:01.209
Tell me.

48:02.022 --> 48:03.788
Say something, you wench.

48:03.812 --> 48:05.878
You should've cornered them even more...

48:05.902 --> 48:08.338
instead of giving them 10 minutes.

48:08.362 --> 48:09.838
They couldn't have run off, could they?

48:09.862 --> 48:11.628
It's not that I don't trust you.

48:11.652 --> 48:13.214
They will come back.

48:13.701 --> 48:15.257
Look at her.

48:15.281 --> 48:18.177
She's young, but she doesn't even weep for mercy.

48:18.201 --> 48:19.576
She just told them to go.

48:19.991 --> 48:21.177
Couldn't you tell by that?

48:21.201 --> 48:23.963
And think of how they looked at her.

48:24.081 --> 48:26.150
I won't doubt you.

48:33.721 --> 48:35.617
- They're here.
- See?

48:35.641 --> 48:36.972
Good to see you.

48:38.471 --> 48:39.697
Welcome.

48:39.721 --> 48:41.283
- It's nice to see you.
- Welcome.

48:46.601 --> 48:47.933
Nice to see you.

48:49.522 --> 48:50.757
Two are missing.

48:50.781 --> 48:52.838
What's there to worry, mister?

48:52.862 --> 48:54.467
Maybe they ran off.

48:54.491 --> 48:56.097
Everyone, back off.

48:56.241 --> 48:57.387
And send Ae Seol over to us first.

48:57.411 --> 48:58.830
The door first.

48:59.201 --> 49:00.387
Open it quickly.

49:00.411 --> 49:02.248
We have no time for this.

49:02.661 --> 49:05.097
Kids, put the guns down.

49:05.121 --> 49:06.307
It's dangerous.

49:06.331 --> 49:08.108
- Tell them to put them far away.
- Yes, put them far away.

49:08.132 --> 49:09.898
Put them away over there.

49:09.922 --> 49:11.438
Put them down.

49:11.462 --> 49:13.148
- Put them down.
- Come on.

49:13.172 --> 49:14.987
There's no need to fight.

49:15.011 --> 49:16.386
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

49:16.632 --> 49:17.697
There's no time.

49:17.721 --> 49:18.737
I won't let you have her.

49:18.761 --> 49:20.411
Do you want her or not?

49:20.971 --> 49:22.721
Hurry up.

49:23.431 --> 49:25.731
- Come on.
- Do you want her?

49:31.772 --> 49:33.938
Now open the door.

49:34.942 --> 49:36.327
Open it.

49:39.072 --> 49:40.177
There you go.

49:40.201 --> 49:41.939
Open it already.

49:43.752 --> 49:45.027
Stick it in.

49:45.502 --> 49:46.833
And turn it.

49:48.422 --> 49:51.029
Now the door is open.

49:53.002 --> 49:55.068
That's smart of you. Good boy.

49:55.092 --> 49:56.588
That's worth an award certificate.

49:56.801 --> 49:58.132
Now let Ae Seol go.

49:58.301 --> 49:59.500
Ae Seol?

49:59.721 --> 50:00.909
Who's that?

50:05.022 --> 50:06.998
Why are you all so serious?

50:07.022 --> 50:09.128
All right. Hey, go.

50:09.152 --> 50:10.338
Send her over.

50:10.362 --> 50:11.957
- Send her over.
- Ae Seol.

50:13.152 --> 50:14.989
It's all right. Let's go.

50:15.362 --> 50:16.923
Goodness, you're heavy.

50:17.951 --> 50:19.228
Let's go.

50:21.161 --> 50:22.597
You went through a lot, Ae Seol.

50:22.621 --> 50:23.887
It was only for a moment,

50:23.911 --> 50:25.286
but my feelings were sincere.

50:26.621 --> 50:27.865
Go.

50:31.042 --> 50:32.285
All right.

50:32.962 --> 50:34.985
Now she's on her way.

50:35.092 --> 50:36.555
Okay? Kids.

50:38.931 --> 50:40.394
This seems to be all.

50:41.342 --> 50:42.540
Gosh, I'm tired.

50:43.551 --> 50:44.882
Why aren't the others coming?

50:47.601 --> 50:49.526
What was that sound?

51:15.962 --> 51:17.160
Goodness!

51:17.922 --> 51:19.076
What is it?

51:30.351 --> 51:31.639
Oh, my.

51:38.822 --> 51:40.054
Now go.

51:44.241 --> 51:45.484
It was a lie!

51:46.121 --> 51:47.347
It was a lie!

51:47.371 --> 51:48.559
Run!

51:48.621 --> 51:50.268
Bang!

51:50.292 --> 51:51.688
One kill. Two kills.

51:51.712 --> 51:52.987
What's "three" in English?

51:53.121 --> 51:56.068
Be gentle. Or they will bleed.

51:56.092 --> 51:57.643
Two, three.

52:01.721 --> 52:03.965
We're finally freed!

52:31.831 --> 52:35.131
(Duty After School)

52:48.601 --> 52:51.264
Even if you all criticize me, it can't be helped.

52:54.891 --> 52:56.641
Now even I don't know...

52:57.732 --> 52:59.063
if I'm doing right.

53:05.241 --> 53:06.572
But...

53:13.201 --> 53:14.719
But I want to put an end to it.

53:33.391 --> 53:36.747
(Duty After School)
