1
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:10,674
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:12,062
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:41,826
What do we do?

4
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:09,693
What's going on?

5
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:11,866
Shoot.

6
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:16,864
Guys, can't we just stay in the truck?

7
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,175
Come on.

8
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:19,837
Move.

9
00:01:21,398 --> 00:01:22,686
Hurry.

10
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:25,428
What is that?

11
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:27,246
Isn't that Class One's truck?

12
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:31,231
Yu Jung, you're with me.

13
00:01:31,948 --> 00:01:33,620
The rest of you, search the perimeter.

14
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,143
To your positions.

15
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,103
Wait.

16
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,644
Did they all get eaten up by the spheres?

17
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:46,112
Hey, stop saying unlucky stuff.

18
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,853
I'm just scared.

19
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,019
So, the kids...

20
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:09,941
What the heck is going on?

21
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,427
What?

22
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:23,892
Lieutenant!

23
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:29,233
Look.

24
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:38,464
They must have hidden.

25
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:40,858
They couldn't have gone far.

26
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:43,625
Duk Joong and Hee Rak, go back down and stay on guard.

27
00:02:43,649 --> 00:02:46,915
Bo Ra and Na Ra, cover our right flank.

28
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,775
Ae Seol, Ha Na, and Yu Jung,

29
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:50,559
come with me.

30
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:53,456
- To your positions.
- Sir.

31
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:05,559
But I'm scared.

32
00:03:14,138 --> 00:03:15,327
What's that?

33
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:17,427
What is it?

34
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,480
Something's flapping over there.

35
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:25,537
Darn it.

36
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:30,752
Lieutenant! It's a sphere!

37
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:34,754
Get ready to fire!

38
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:40,608
Oh, no.

39
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:42,477
What do I do?

40
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:12,146
Move.

41
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:20,323
Fire!

42
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,971
Die, scum!

43
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:28,844
Die!

44
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,638
Get the key!

45
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,073
Shoot.

46
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,724
Hey, punk!

47
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,535
Get in the truck. Now!

48
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:42,889
Shoot.

49
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,517
- Do you think you can reach it?
- Come on.

50
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:50,622
Darn.

51
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:55,939
- Kill them!
- Die!

52
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:23,168
Crap.

53
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:26,363
Can you reach it?

54
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:30,535
Hee Rak, get in the truck.

55
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,857
Just a little more. No?

56
00:05:36,609 --> 00:05:37,709
What?

57
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:41,561
- Here.
- Get in the truck now!

58
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:49,887
Start the truck!

59
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:53,814
We're ready!

60
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:55,258
Okay. Drive.

61
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,459
Here I go.

62
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:59,621
Hang on tight!

63
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,379
Jang Soo...

64
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:44,259
What do we do about him?

65
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:53,350
Where's Hee Rak?

66
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:38,337
Crap.

67
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:09,341
Crap! Go away!

68
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:46,735
Freak!

69
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:05,480
Stupid. Where's your bluff now?

70
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:10,701
I remembered that the thing was weak against the cold.

71
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,627
I wasn't sure, but...

72
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:18,195
Are you laughing?

73
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:33,580
Here.

74
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,111
Idiot.

75
00:09:49,738 --> 00:09:51,388
Did you think I'd help you up?

76
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:55,272
Let's go.

77
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,245
Let's go!

78
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:10,604
I was the one who saved you.

79
00:10:10,628 --> 00:10:12,972
Why are you acting like the hero?

80
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:23,162
By the way,

81
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:25,479
why did you do it?

82
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:27,547
Do what?

83
00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:30,795
Stop trying to be a hero.

84
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:32,871
Whatever.

85
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,611
We're so incompatible.

86
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:06,415
I thought I'd never see you again!

87
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:07,725
Do you want some water?

88
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:15,795
- Where do you think you're going?
- What?

89
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,844
We thought that we'd lost you.

90
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:20,304
Don't even get me started on that. We barely made it out.

91
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:22,765
We had it pretty tough too.

92
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:24,684
- Right, Duk Joong?
- It was legendary.

93
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,814
We'd need more than three days...

94
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:28,763
to finish telling our story.

95
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,820
Jang Soo.

96
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,205
Am I wrong?

97
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:37,669
Four days.

98
00:11:40,598 --> 00:11:43,811
- What did he say?
- That was so random.

99
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,204
- Lame.
- Lame.

100
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:47,878
You're so boring.

101
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,755
- Guys.
- You still smell.

102
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,584
- What?
- Take a shower, please!

103
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,635
- I did. Four days ago.
- What?

104
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:57,545
- Why?
- That's impossible.

105
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:58,635
It's good to see you alive.

106
00:11:58,659 --> 00:11:59,674
Wasn't there water?

107
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,030
What?

108
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,804
- I'm so glad to have you back.
- Get off me.

109
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:05,972
Same here.

110
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,828
Come here, Hee Rak!

111
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:13,934
- Is that okay?
- What's wrong with you?

112
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:15,814
I hurt myself.

113
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:18,025
- How?
- No, she's just being a crybaby.

114
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:19,074
- She is!
- Seriously.

115
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:20,405
Oh, my gosh.

116
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:22,079
How are you doing?

117
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,745
Fine.

118
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:25,231
We'll get you treated soon.

119
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,537
Are you okay?

120
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,555
Are you hurt?

121
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:35,950
Well, I'm fine.

122
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,514
That's a relief.

123
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:40,933
I was worried sick.

124
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:42,187
What?

125
00:12:45,118 --> 00:12:46,724
I'm relieved...

126
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:49,869
that everyone's safe.

127
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:56,415
Right. Me too.

128
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:02,215
Thanks...

129
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:05,599
for coming for us.

130
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:37,428
- Won Bin!
- What?

131
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:39,294
- Kids!
- Won Bin!

132
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:42,485
- Won Bin!
- Look who's here!

133
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:43,944
- I can't believe it!
- You guys came!

134
00:13:43,968 --> 00:13:45,399
Are you all feeling okay?

135
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:47,405
Are you hurt or anything?

136
00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:48,615
- No.
- Are you okay?

137
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,165
You look way older.

138
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:52,300
I got older every second I waited for you.

139
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:54,619
- You're all safe?
- Yes.

140
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:56,388
Young Soo!

141
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:02,294
- You're here.
- Hey.

142
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,081
It sounds like you don't want us here.

143
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:07,831
Selfish bastard.

144
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,991
If we had failed to come, he would have celebrated...

145
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:12,754
having less competition.

146
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,751
Come on, buddy.

147
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:19,149
Young Soo!

148
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:24,720
Did you set up all these by yourself for your classmates?

149
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,371
Good work.

150
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:28,632
Young Soo was...

151
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:30,701
also worried about you guys.

152
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,463
So, don't give him a hard time.

153
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:38,843
Attention.

154
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,174
Great job on making it alive.

155
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:43,585
This is the boys' tent, and this is the girls' tent.

156
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:44,891
To your tents!

157
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,594
You want us to rest here?

158
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:48,554
But we narrowly escaped death on our way here.

159
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:49,997
You'll have to get used to it.

160
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:53,798
The cots are 1st-come-1st-served.

161
00:14:53,828 --> 00:14:55,028
To your positions!

162
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:00,523
What?

163
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:04,985
You're so sneaky!

164
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:06,593
- Hurry.
- I want to go to the back!

165
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,985
Thanks.

166
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,252
Yes!

167
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:12,694
Awesome. It's soft.

168
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:15,752
I was dying to wash. They have everything here.

169
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:22,343
Lieutenant.

170
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:24,264
Sergeant.

171
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:27,552
Welcome back.

172
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:30,556
Take care of the kids.

173
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,698
Check this out! See?

174
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,934
- Hey.
- Not so fast.

175
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,795
Come on!

176
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,314
I'm taking it.

177
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:42,352
- Stop all this fight.
- Get him!

178
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:45,865
But I want it!

179
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:47,396
Not on my watch.

180
00:15:47,968 --> 00:15:50,495
- Catch him!
- Come here.

181
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,704
- But I want it.
- Throw it.

182
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:54,103
Throw it away.

183
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:55,569
You ought to be executed!

184
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:58,204
Going AWOL, using unauthorized gear,

185
00:15:58,228 --> 00:15:59,648
and insubordination!

186
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:01,353
What else?

187
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,248
- I apologize, sir.
- "Apologize?"

188
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:07,806
Buddy.

189
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:11,912
Is that your apologizing look?

190
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:18,553
- I ought to...
- Sir!

191
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,480
You'll be shot to death next time.

192
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:30,599
Eventually, you brought the kids here safely.

193
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,270
We'll at least be able to tell the superiors and parents something.

194
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,878
Thank you, sir.

195
00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:38,314
You're a madman.

196
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:40,590
Dismissed.

197
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:45,755
That imbecile.

198
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,674
I can't even send him to prison.

199
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:49,162
Should we send him?

200
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:51,627
What are you talking about?

201
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:54,020
He's twice as better a soldier as you are.

202
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:56,484
Gosh.

- He looks good!
- Look at you.

206
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:20,454
You look like a middle-aged woman.

207
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:24,262
Hi!

208
00:18:27,628 --> 00:18:28,854
Stop filming.

209
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:31,275
You certainly know who the cutest girl is.

210
00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:33,025
It's better than I thought.

211
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:35,347
Soon Yi. How do I look?

212
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:37,903
Check this out.

213
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:42,981
Get that camera out of my face!

214
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:44,471
How are you?

215
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:46,666
You guys are a cute couple!

216
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,216
Beautiful.

I'm jealous.

We're not trainees anymore. We're reservists.

219

But now that I'm in uniform,

220
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:03,222
it feels so odd.

221
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:08,985

I still can't believe it.

229

You have to shave this part nicely.

230

- You need to be careful.
- Gosh.

231
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,969
It was torn.

232

- I'm really sorry.
- Hey.

Pervert.

- What?
- What happened?

- Use that one.
- This one?

- They're not.

Don't you think we're shovelling too often?

- It's gone!

- What?

- My underwear!
- Gosh.

No!

This is a fun activity, compared to other drills.

Be optimistic and consider it camping.

Darn it.

308
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:54,488
It doesn't go in! This is so messed up.

The group that fails to set it up properly...

310
00:22:57,229 --> 00:22:59,045
will have to take it apart and start over.

These are the tents that we'll use in the actual battle,

312

so stop fooling around. Take this seriously!

313

Okay.

Hey, Yu Jung! Come here.

317
00:23:14,328 --> 00:23:17,185
I can't be in this group. Let me move to a new one.

318

It's like they're crying for milk.

Just get in there!

320
00:23:26,678 --> 00:23:28,904
That boy from another school was pretty cute.

321
00:23:28,928 --> 00:23:31,074
He asked for my number.

322
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:33,486
But we don't even have phones.

323
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:35,535
What about the boy in Class One?

324
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,263
I ended things with him already.

325
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:39,052
He doesn't get training.

326
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,794
I can't date a guy who hasn't even fired a rifle.

327

Men who haven't finished their military service...

328
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:46,175
are little boys to me now.

329
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:47,634
Whatever you say.

330
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:48,803
Hey.

331
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,022
You do it. I'm done.

332
00:23:51,368 --> 00:23:54,554
But I can't do it if you can't do it!

333
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:56,372
Oh, gosh.

334
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:57,857
Let me try.

335
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,394
Na Ra!

336
00:24:03,418 --> 00:24:05,064
- Ae Seol, hold on tightly.
- Wait.

337
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:06,420
Give me a second.

338
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,505
Seriously. What are you doing?

339
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:14,785
What is the matter with you?

340
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:16,646
Sorry.

341
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,383
Hold onto it!

342
00:24:42,838 --> 00:24:43,854
Hi, Bo Ra.

343
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:45,209
Hey, No Ae.

344
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:49,047
Why don't you just drop out?

345
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:54,020
- Why?
- It's for your own good.

346
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,256
What do you get from staying here?

347
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:59,175
Are you dying to go to college too?

348
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,721
No, right?

349
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:03,728
Who cares about college?

350
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:07,311
You could get in serious trouble if you stayed.

351
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:10,332
I'm not leaving.

352
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:12,344
All my friends are here.

353
00:25:12,368 --> 00:25:14,437
You don't have any friends!

354
00:25:15,368 --> 00:25:17,249
Ae Seol does have friends.

355
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:22,741
Gosh.

356
00:25:23,878 --> 00:25:26,947
Never mind. I shouldn't have said anything.

357
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,808
Stop being nosy about everything.

358
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:47,450
What is the meaning of being nosy?

359
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:54,204
Na Ra, are you being a show-off for being a good marksman?

360
00:25:54,408 --> 00:25:57,475
Why do you care what I say to No Ae?

361
00:25:57,499 --> 00:25:58,515
You're always on her...

362
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:01,475
You probably feel fine because you manage everything.

363
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:04,347
Do you think you'll be accepting when she causes you trouble?

364
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:06,270
You don't know anything.

365
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:10,872
Neither do you.

366
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:17,615
I don't manage everything.

367
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:21,943
- What?
- We're all trying as we suffer.

368
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,387
The same applies to Ae Seol.

369
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:36,175
As you can see, most medium spheres...

370
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:38,094
have fallen.

371
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:41,435
We seem to have eliminated 20 percent of the smaller spheres.

372
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:45,220
In the process, unfortunately, we have lost...

373
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:47,144
about 50 percent of our soldiers.

374
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:50,394
Most of these spheres are crowded in the city.

375
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:53,864
There are fewer spheres in the suburbs.

376
00:26:53,888 --> 00:26:56,285
We believe that this is because the spheres...

377
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:58,871
take nourishment from humans.

378
00:26:58,979 --> 00:27:00,167
So,

379
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:02,343
because they feed on humans,

380
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:06,392
they're mostly where there are people.

381
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:08,334
- Is that what you mean?
- Yes, sir.

382
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:09,874
Also, since we figured out...

383
00:27:09,898 --> 00:27:11,923
that the spheres are weak against the cold,

384
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:14,215
the UN has been developing cryogenic weapons...

385
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:16,134
to get rid of them.

386
00:27:16,158 --> 00:27:17,384
We can't just wait for them.

387
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:19,433
We're hopelessly outnumbered, sir.

388
00:27:19,658 --> 00:27:22,002
It will get cold soon, so we can wait until...

389
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,564
If the large spheres drop as we wait,

390
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:30,646
and we all die!

391
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,775
While the main units eliminate the spheres,

392
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,922
we need to stop those tiny evil beings!

393
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:43,088
Hey.

394
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:47,215
What's the use of Student Reserve Forces?

395
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:56,821
The military and the people are...

396
00:27:57,828 --> 00:28:00,072
well aware of your hard work.

397
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:03,455
There have been sacrifices along the way,

398
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:07,183
but you are the proud sons and daughters...

399
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:10,205
that protect this nation from alien beings.

400
00:28:10,418 --> 00:28:12,168
Have pride in it.

401
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:14,235
- Hey.
- To end this war...

402
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,485
What do you think he wants that it takes so long to build it up?

403
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:18,025
- Maybe...
- Eliminating...

404
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:19,785
- he's sending us home.
- The smaller spheres...

405
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:21,865
- Seriously?
- No way.

406
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:24,051
I'm worried.

407
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:25,460
From now on,

408
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:27,955
I will make the important announcement.

409
00:28:27,979 --> 00:28:29,221
Sorry.

410
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,414
At 0700 hours the succeeding day,

411
00:28:30,438 --> 00:28:32,414
the reservists of the second platoon,

412
00:28:32,438 --> 00:28:34,232
Class 3-2 of Sungjin High School,

413
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,260
will carry out an operation of eliminating the spheres.

414
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,510
- An operation?
- What?

415
00:28:39,578 --> 00:28:41,425
- Are we going to war?
- What is this nonsense?

416
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:43,935
- There's no way.
- I thought we were going home!

417
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:46,291
- This makes no sense.
- What's "the succeeding day?"

418
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:49,389
It means tomorrow.

419
00:28:50,668 --> 00:28:52,549
Quiet!

420
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,942
Second Platoon leader.

421
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:14,712
Second Platoon...

422
00:29:15,358 --> 00:29:18,208
will leave the camp tomorrow at 0700 hours,

423
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:21,300
join the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Brigade,

424
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,590
and carry out...

425
00:29:25,908 --> 00:29:27,239
the clean-up operation.

426
00:29:27,828 --> 00:29:29,072
Crap.

427
00:29:29,078 --> 00:29:32,015
The objective of this operation is to go through...

428
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,854
the nearby residential areas...

429
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:35,397
and head to Maesong-Si.

430
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:38,057
We must eliminate as many spheres...

431
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:41,854
we encounter along the way as possible.

432
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,070
As you know, these are hard times.

433
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:50,273
Most national infrastructure collapsed,

434
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:52,092
and we've lost numerous soldiers.

435
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:54,150
We're in desperate need of riflemen.

436
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:58,342
Keep in mind that you are currently soldiers.

437
00:30:00,739 --> 00:30:03,720
What about the CSAT?

438
00:30:04,328 --> 00:30:05,884
I really need to take the CSAT.

439
00:30:05,908 --> 00:30:07,239
Shut it.

440
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:08,862
No way.

441
00:30:10,828 --> 00:30:13,765
After the operation, you will take the test as scheduled.

442
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:16,077
Given that you conducted the operation successfully,

443
00:30:16,418 --> 00:30:18,178
not only will you get extra CSAT scores,

444
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:22,735
but you will also return to your family.

445
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:29,293
Dismissed!

446
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:46,962
Heck.

447
00:30:47,868 --> 00:30:49,562
I knew something was up.

448
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:52,976
I asked the other kids,

449
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:56,354
and we're going first because we're the largest group.

450
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:57,709
This is so annoying.

451
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:01,712
Who made a fuss about being discharged?

452
00:31:07,428 --> 00:31:08,628
I can't eat.

453
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:11,921
Well, that's a first.

454
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:16,198
You're right. Being able to eat in this situation would be bizarre.

455
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,576
A will, sir?

456
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:37,193
(Kim Yu Jung, Yeon Bo Ra...)

457
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:39,574
But they're already scared.

458
00:31:41,628 --> 00:31:42,828
How would we ask them?

459
00:31:48,138 --> 00:31:50,207
- I'll hand them out.
- Leave them.

460
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:53,163
This will...

461
00:31:54,148 --> 00:31:56,304
only put you in a fix.

462
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:04,767
Lieutenant!

463
00:32:17,588 --> 00:32:19,513
(No Ae Seol)

464
00:32:20,878 --> 00:32:22,022
(Cho Young Sin)

465
00:32:31,719 --> 00:32:34,985
Apparently, writing a will is...

466
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:36,816
only a formality before an operation.

467
00:32:37,229 --> 00:32:39,245
Also, cut your fingernails or your hair...

468
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:42,624
to submit them in these bags. These are for...

469
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:49,425
These are for your funeral...

470
00:32:49,449 --> 00:32:50,925
when they can't find your body.

471
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:53,844
What? Are we going out to die?

472
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:55,225
No, that's not it.

473
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:57,130
Stop scaring us.

474
00:32:57,789 --> 00:32:59,604
It's a formality.

475
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:03,525
Exactly. Why do we need to do it if it's only a formality?

476
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:06,025
It's because it's going to be dangerous!

477
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:08,161
I thought we were being discharged.

478
00:33:08,388 --> 00:33:11,094
Why are they sending us for an operation?

479
00:33:11,638 --> 00:33:13,285
I'm not sure about that. But...

480
00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:14,452
Hey.

481
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:17,351
Ask again if you're not sure.

482
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:20,084
Ask them if this is necessary...

483
00:33:20,108 --> 00:33:22,265
- Ha Na, stop.
- She's the class president.

484
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:24,769
Why don't you even ask them such things?

485
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:29,541
You had the nerve to just accept these?

486
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:33,134
Hey, stop yelling at her.

487
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:35,475
You couldn't even say a word in front of the commander.

488
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:36,918
So what?

489
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:38,725
She's Senior Private.

490
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:40,630
Then, she should represent all of us.

491
00:33:41,588 --> 00:33:43,314
Are you grubbing...

492
00:33:43,338 --> 00:33:45,351
for extra CSAT scores, or what?

493
00:33:45,969 --> 00:33:47,113
You do it.

494
00:33:47,168 --> 00:33:49,275
You little punk. What did you say to her?

495
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:51,136
Let go of me, jerk.

496
00:33:51,928 --> 00:33:53,864
- Darn you.
- Stop fighting, guys.

497
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:55,582
What do you want?

498
00:33:55,979 --> 00:33:57,529
Jerk.

499
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:13,708
Yu Jung, how are you so unaffected?

500
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,804
Doesn't this scare you?

501
00:34:16,328 --> 00:34:18,759
Man, I hate this.

502
00:34:21,998 --> 00:34:23,142
Yu Jung.

503
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:27,695
Even for me, a will doesn't sound right.

504
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:51,758
Ridiculous.

505
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:22,493
Jang Soo.

506
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:25,550
To be honest, I became the class president...

507
00:35:26,188 --> 00:35:27,938
for the student records.

508
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:30,546
At first,

509
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:32,929
I had zero consideration...

510
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:35,972
for a sense of duty or responsibility.

511
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:45,144
By only a one-vote difference,

512
00:35:45,168 --> 00:35:47,830
you became the president, and I the vice president.

513
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:49,442
Do you remember?

514
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:54,785
I just realized how lucky I was.

515
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,843
Because I couldn't have done it as well as you.

516
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:16,553
Hey, Kimchi.

517
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:18,732
Are you sleeping?

518
00:36:19,788 --> 00:36:22,440
No. I can't fall asleep.

519
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:26,616
Do you remember the beginning of the semester...

520
00:36:26,628 --> 00:36:28,684
when we made a list of girls by popularity?

521
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:30,633
Yes, I do remember.

522
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:33,214
Was So Yeon in first place?

523
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:36,819
- And Ha Na was second?
- Hey.

524
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:38,655
The girls found out about it later on...

525
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,655
they threw a fit.

526
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,329
I was terrified.

527
00:36:42,518 --> 00:36:43,707
Me too.

528
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,494
Seeing the girls without washing or cleaning themselves up,

529
00:36:48,518 --> 00:36:50,914
the difference is noticeable.

530
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:54,569
This must be what's truly scary about war.

531
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:55,931
It's terrifying.

532
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:57,639
Some aren't different.

533
00:37:06,668 --> 00:37:07,900
Kimchi.

534
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:09,187
What?

535
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,985
We used to take classes,

536
00:37:13,009 --> 00:37:15,934
go to Internet cafés, and goof around.

537
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:19,182
Days passed by without me giving much thought to it.

538
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:21,704
I never imagined...

539
00:37:22,389 --> 00:37:24,083
this would happen to us.

540
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:28,414
- Ouch.
- What was that?

541
00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:31,744
You're talking too much. I can't sleep.

542
00:37:31,768 --> 00:37:35,674
Did we wake you up? I'm sorry.

543
00:37:37,148 --> 00:37:39,261
Can anyone sleep right now?

544
00:37:45,038 --> 00:37:47,425
The thought of having to sleep is keeping me awake.

545
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:54,228
Hi.

546
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:56,762
You can't sleep either, right?

547
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:05,521
It's merciless.

548
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:06,993
The kids...

549
00:38:08,478 --> 00:38:09,578
Wait.

550
00:38:09,808 --> 00:38:10,908
Where did it go?

551
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,341
You're all here.

552
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,867
I can't sleep.

553
00:38:57,188 --> 00:38:59,894
It's tomorrow. What are we supposed to do?

554
00:39:00,148 --> 00:39:02,925
I'm really scared.

555
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:06,095
It won't be that dangerous in the suburbs.

556
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,514
Then why would they have us write our wills?

557
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:13,264
They'll let us go home if we get through this.

558
00:39:13,288 --> 00:39:15,906
That's the only reason I'm going.

559
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:17,755
If we get through this...

560
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:25,871
I miss my parents.

561
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:27,989
Me too.

562
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:31,158
Darn it.

563
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:34,834
- Mom...
- I miss my mom's kimchi jjigae.

564
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:36,164
- I'd gulp it down.
- Mom.

565
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:38,914
I miss my mom.

566
00:39:38,938 --> 00:39:41,325
- I miss my mom.
- What else?

567
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:44,225
Quiet.

568
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:47,534
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

569
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,729
It's hot in here.

570
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,345
- Sorry.
- Stop it.

571
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:53,711
- Move it.
- Stop it.

572
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:58,209
- Won Bin.
- Duk Joong.

573
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:07,573
You guys.

574
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:16,099
I'm sorry.

575
00:40:16,268 --> 00:40:18,017
We couldn't sleep.

576
00:40:18,608 --> 00:40:20,171
We'll go back immediately.

577
00:40:20,938 --> 00:40:22,795
- We should sleep.
- Go on.

578
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:24,084
Let's go.

579
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:25,208
You guys.

580
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:29,234
I heard you didn't have dinner.

581
00:40:34,038 --> 00:40:35,183
Sergeant Kim.

582
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:36,808
Yes, sir.

583
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,627
Bring that over now.

584
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:41,360
Yes, sir.

585
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:48,025
What is this?

586
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:49,445
- What is it?
- I don't know.

587
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:51,581
- It's bread.
- Is it good?

588
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:30,776
This is a magic trick that turns hardtacks into a cupcake.

589
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:31,909
There you go.

590
00:41:37,018 --> 00:41:38,349
- Duk Joong.
- Yes?

591
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:44,755
It smells amazing.

592
00:41:44,779 --> 00:41:46,005
It's so good.

593
00:41:46,029 --> 00:41:47,910
- It really is.
- Hey.

594
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:52,839
Caught it.

595
00:41:58,498 --> 00:42:00,610
- Nice.
- Good job.

596
00:42:03,998 --> 00:42:05,110
Catch.

597
00:42:10,588 --> 00:42:12,695
I didn't know hardtacks were this good.

598
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:14,825
- I used to throw them away.
- Me too.

599
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:16,916
The hardtack-sando is amazing.

600
00:42:17,058 --> 00:42:20,678
I'll salivate when I see hardtacks from now on like Pavlov's dog.

601
00:42:21,268 --> 00:42:24,349
You mean the dog of Flanders.

602
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,387
Patrasche?

603
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:39,821
You can be the dog.

604
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:45,995
Forget it if I'm wrong.

605
00:42:46,418 --> 00:42:48,314
- You didn't...
- How could you?

606
00:42:48,338 --> 00:42:49,857
No way.

607
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,050
What are you doing?

608
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:56,752
Tae Man!

609
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,379
Look at him.

610
00:43:00,139 --> 00:43:01,612
Look at that.

611
00:43:01,938 --> 00:43:03,038
Hey.

612
00:43:03,688 --> 00:43:06,075
- How dare you play with food!
- Old man.

613
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:12,102
Stop it.

614
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,339
Stop it.

615
00:43:15,409 --> 00:43:16,509
Look.

616
00:43:17,288 --> 00:43:18,388
Look!

617
00:43:19,498 --> 00:43:21,237
You don't get it, do you?

618
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,604
- Do you?
- Won Bin.

619
00:43:23,628 --> 00:43:24,764
Let go of me.

620
00:43:24,788 --> 00:43:25,888
What?

621
00:43:32,338 --> 00:43:33,438
I'm sorry.

622
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:35,744
I'm sorry.

623
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:38,106
Kim Won Bin.

624
00:43:48,228 --> 00:43:49,295
Get him.

625
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:51,562
- Take this.
- I'll get you.

626
00:44:46,878 --> 00:44:49,104
- We're a mess.
- I'm covered in it.

627
00:44:49,128 --> 00:44:51,184
- Look at you.
- You look worse.

628
00:44:51,208 --> 00:44:53,854
You're so childish, Lieutenant Lee.

629
00:44:53,878 --> 00:44:56,195
You look like you're having more fun than we are.

630
00:44:56,219 --> 00:44:57,485
That was cruel.

631
00:44:57,509 --> 00:44:58,865
He's right.

632
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:02,925
What did you do before you came here, Lieutenant?

633
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:05,108
I was part of a combat unit.

634
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:07,481
No, before that.

635
00:45:07,648 --> 00:45:09,661
Did you go to university?

636
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:15,683
Do you have a girlfriend?

637
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:19,645
You little...

638
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:24,514
I don't take questions unrelated to training.

639
00:45:24,538 --> 00:45:25,555
Do you hear me?

640
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:27,764
He has a girlfriend.

641
00:45:27,788 --> 00:45:29,305
No, he doesn't.

642
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:30,483
- Hey.
- What?

643
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:39,096
If we all go home...

644
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:41,825
and the war ends, what will you do? Will you go back to school?

645
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:45,284
I said I won't take questions unrelated to training.

646
00:45:45,308 --> 00:45:47,101
It's related.

647
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:50,624
We have to know more about you...

648
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:53,817
for the platoon members to be more efficient.

649
00:45:57,569 --> 00:45:59,262
Change the subject.

650
00:46:01,449 --> 00:46:02,925
- Fine.
- Come on.

651
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:06,095
- Tell us.
- Please tell us.

652
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:08,135
Tell us.

653
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:10,271
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

654
00:46:10,288 --> 00:46:14,224
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

655
00:46:14,248 --> 00:46:17,394
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

656
00:46:17,418 --> 00:46:19,485
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

657
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:21,390
- Tell us.
- Stop it.

658
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:29,618
Listen.

659
00:46:34,728 --> 00:46:38,040
I'm part of the ROTC, so I joined after graduating from university.

660
00:46:38,398 --> 00:46:40,973
I have a year left to serve,

661
00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:44,839
but I haven't decided whether I'll leave...

662
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:47,845
or extend my term. That's it.

663
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:50,684
Extend? Why would you do any more of this?

664
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,055
I know, isn't it tiring?

665
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:56,389
- Better to go out into the world.
- You're right.

666
00:46:56,918 --> 00:46:59,894
Being out in the world is tough too.

667
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:03,318
I'm still young and don't know much,

668
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:05,350
but it's a war out there too.

669
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:08,788
You could say getting into universities is a local war,

670
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:10,697
and being out in the world is a world war.

671
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:14,608
This is the happiest you'll be.

672
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:28,179
I have a question.

673
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,234
When will this war end?

674
00:47:35,088 --> 00:47:36,232
Will...

675
00:47:38,799 --> 00:47:40,636
we be able to go home?

676
00:47:41,668 --> 00:47:45,343
They said we can go home if we get through this operation.

677
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:47,577
Can we...

678
00:47:48,259 --> 00:47:49,644
believe that?

679
00:47:50,808 --> 00:47:54,933
Don't think we don't know anything because we're kids.

680
00:47:56,978 --> 00:47:58,374
Tell us the truth.

681
00:47:58,398 --> 00:48:00,973
What if we get stabbed in the back after trusting it?

682
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:15,490
I don't know when the war will end.

683
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:21,422
But just remember this.

684
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:27,038
Survive to the end.

685
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:31,477
I can't end the war for you,

686
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:37,512
but I will help you fight to the end...

687
00:48:40,148 --> 00:48:41,611
without anyone getting hurt.

688
00:48:44,608 --> 00:48:46,258
I can promise you that.

689
00:49:04,168 --> 00:49:05,280
Let's go.

690
00:49:10,929 --> 00:49:13,821
Squad One, marksman Cho Jang Soo.

691
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:15,805
Assistant marksman Kook Young Soo.

692
00:49:16,308 --> 00:49:18,926
Squad Two, marksman Kim Yu Jung.

693
00:49:19,058 --> 00:49:20,851
Assistant marksman Wang Tae Man.

694
00:49:21,518 --> 00:49:22,630
Me?

695
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:24,465
No.

696
00:49:24,489 --> 00:49:27,370
Search team, Cho Young Sin, Kwon Il Ha.

697
00:49:27,449 --> 00:49:31,805
Sniper Lee Na Ra, spotter Do Soo Chul.

698
00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:37,264
When we arrive at our destination,

699
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:39,125
the raiding party will put the guard up.

700
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,644
The two people in the search party...

701
00:49:40,668 --> 00:49:42,314
will take the lead and request troops.

702
00:49:42,338 --> 00:49:43,526
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

703
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:54,635
This is a sphere detector.

704
00:49:55,018 --> 00:49:56,704
- A sphere detector.
- What is that?

705
00:49:56,728 --> 00:49:58,147
Does it detect spheres?

706
00:49:58,648 --> 00:50:00,784
He just said it's a sphere detector.

707
00:50:00,808 --> 00:50:02,414
Why do you think it's called that?

708
00:50:02,438 --> 00:50:03,913
Is it a prototype?

709
00:50:04,279 --> 00:50:05,256
What is that?

710
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,715
Something that hasn't been fully developed yet.

711
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:10,545
You're right. It isn't perfect yet.

712
00:50:10,569 --> 00:50:13,693
So don't rely on it too much.

713
00:50:13,788 --> 00:50:14,885
What's its radius?

714
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:17,305
It's 1km in open areas.

715
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:18,974
In the city of villages,

716
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:21,684
it'll only be 500 to 700m.

717
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:22,808
So,

718
00:50:24,498 --> 00:50:25,644
always be alert.

719
00:50:25,668 --> 00:50:26,768
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

720
00:50:27,168 --> 00:50:28,268
That's it.

721
00:50:32,389 --> 00:50:34,721
Let's go. Come here.

722
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:36,494
- Look at that.
- It's amazing.

723
00:50:36,518 --> 00:50:38,026
- Turn it on.
- Turn it on.

724
00:50:43,819 --> 00:50:45,834
The people high up aren't just sitting back and watching.

725
00:50:45,858 --> 00:50:47,914
You're right. Why didn't they give this to us earlier?

726
00:50:47,938 --> 00:50:49,413
Look at that.

727
00:50:51,029 --> 00:50:52,129
What's this?

728
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:54,607
Why isn't it detecting anything?

729
00:50:54,779 --> 00:50:55,934
Seriously?

730
00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:00,596
- Since there is no sphere.
- Since there is no sphere.

731
00:51:02,998 --> 00:51:05,224
- That idiot.
- Seriously.

732
00:51:05,248 --> 00:51:06,314
Three minutes until we leave.

733
00:51:06,338 --> 00:51:09,604
Divide into your squads and get in the vehicles.

734
00:51:09,628 --> 00:51:11,064
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

735
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:13,615
- Duk Joong.
- What is it?

736
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:15,014
Hurry up.

737
00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:57,875
Darn it.

738
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,162
Lieutenant.

739
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:06,930
We'll need equipment to move this.

740
00:52:11,398 --> 00:52:13,873
Let's search the area first.

741
00:52:29,248 --> 00:52:30,997
Walk in a straight line.

742
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:33,164
How does this work?

743
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:35,313
I can tell you're a nerd.

744
00:52:35,588 --> 00:52:38,655
We just marvel at how cool it is,

745
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:40,329
but don't care about how it works.

746
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:44,193
I'm not a nerd. It's my family's genes.

747
00:52:45,438 --> 00:52:47,495
They're good genes.

748
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:52,594
- Bam.
- What?

749
00:52:53,438 --> 00:52:54,925
- Stop it.
- Cut it out.

750
00:52:54,949 --> 00:52:56,084
Go ahead.

751
00:52:56,108 --> 00:52:57,583
You go ahead.

752
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:02,885
Do you have the safety on?

753
00:53:02,909 --> 00:53:04,009
What?

754
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:06,700
Yes, I do.

755
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:10,127
Don't shoot me in the back.

756
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:13,751
You just have to turn this a little.

757
00:53:22,558 --> 00:53:23,535
I'm scared.

758
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:26,353
I am too.

759
00:53:27,398 --> 00:53:29,784
No Ae, keep up with us.

760
00:53:29,808 --> 00:53:30,920
Okay.

761
00:53:31,268 --> 00:53:33,105
- Yu Jung.
- Yes?

762
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:34,903
Why do you keep checking behind you?

763
00:53:35,188 --> 00:53:36,850
We have to watch our backs.

764
00:53:39,779 --> 00:53:41,572
Just walk backward.

765
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:44,704
Is that better?

766
00:53:52,338 --> 00:53:53,845
- Help.
- I got you.

767
00:53:55,338 --> 00:53:56,526
Are you okay?

768
00:53:56,838 --> 00:53:57,938
Yes.

769
00:53:58,838 --> 00:53:59,938
I'm fine.

770
00:54:00,509 --> 00:54:01,653
Thank you.

771
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:05,137
I didn't think you'd really walk backward.

772
00:54:06,808 --> 00:54:08,733
You're clumsier than I thought.

773
00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:17,450
I feel queasy.

774
00:54:18,819 --> 00:54:21,393
What is going on?

775
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,490
Let's see.

776
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:28,555
I know women.

777
00:54:28,579 --> 00:54:31,604
You have it all wrong, Young Soo.

778
00:54:31,628 --> 00:54:33,135
Then what should I do?

779
00:54:34,088 --> 00:54:36,604
Do better.

780
00:54:36,628 --> 00:54:38,653
Be manly and cool.

781
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,592
Be careful, Na Ra.

782
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:45,743
Okay.

783
00:54:48,728 --> 00:54:50,378
Be careful, Ha Na.

784
00:54:50,438 --> 00:54:52,495
Get out of my way.

785
00:54:53,518 --> 00:54:55,058
She wants me to get out of her way.

786
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:05,855
Are you anxious?

787
00:55:05,989 --> 00:55:07,089
About what?

788
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:08,913
Those two.

789
00:55:10,409 --> 00:55:11,838
It's like a melodrama.

790
00:55:14,248 --> 00:55:19,341
And this man that watches from afar.

791
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:21,649
Hey.

792
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:23,808
Let's go quietly.

793
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:26,509
I have enough on my mind.

794
00:55:28,268 --> 00:55:33,034
Doesn't this feel like an operation?

795
00:55:33,058 --> 00:55:36,084
We are on an operation.

796
00:55:36,108 --> 00:55:37,252
Focus.

797
00:55:37,319 --> 00:55:38,419
Whatever.

798
00:55:40,989 --> 00:55:43,145
Quiet.

799
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:48,224
Show yourselves, spheres.

800
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:49,474
Come on.

801
00:55:49,498 --> 00:55:51,148
Cut it out.

802
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:53,684
Wait, over there.

803
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:54,941
You scared me.

804
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:58,062
- Look.
- Unbelievable.

805
00:55:58,498 --> 00:55:59,654
Awesome.

806
00:56:01,509 --> 00:56:02,884
Isn't it working?

807
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:04,117
Hee Rak.

808
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:05,899
What is it?

809
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:08,073
It's nothing, sir.

810
00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:09,537
Lieutenant.

811
00:56:16,478 --> 00:56:17,622
What is it?

812
00:56:18,518 --> 00:56:19,704
Look what I got.

813
00:56:19,728 --> 00:56:21,664
- Unbelievable.
- Give me some.

814
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:23,215
- Ouch.
- I want a sip.

815
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:25,795
I'm going to save it, so get away from me.

816
00:56:25,819 --> 00:56:28,425
- Don't be cheap. Share with us.
- Don't be cheap. Share with us.

817
00:56:28,449 --> 00:56:30,305
You shouldn't shake cola, right?

818
00:56:30,329 --> 00:56:33,305
But I can since this is mine.

819
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:35,165
- Why you...
- Why you...

820
00:56:35,829 --> 00:56:37,027
I love this.

821
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:40,689
- Forget it.
- Forget it.

822
00:56:45,219 --> 00:56:47,056
Lieutenant.

823
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:52,993
Il Ha.

824
00:56:59,398 --> 00:57:00,498
What's its location?

825
00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:06,790
It's 300m to the southwest.

826
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:15,075
That hurts.

827
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:17,672
Why did you come this way?

828
00:58:46,878 --> 00:58:47,978
What was that?

829
00:59:20,998 --> 00:59:22,231
Lieutenant.

830
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:23,394
Lieutenant.

831
00:59:23,418 --> 00:59:25,434
- Get ready to fire.
- Lieutenant.

832
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:27,184
- Are they coming?
- Over there.

833
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:29,025
- They're coming.
- What should we do?

834
00:59:29,049 --> 00:59:31,799
- Shoot them.
- Hurry.

835
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:33,525
- They're coming.
- I don't think I can.

836
00:59:33,549 --> 00:59:35,474
Hold your fire.

837
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:39,075
All right.

838
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:40,749
Open fire.

839
00:59:49,898 --> 00:59:52,473
To the left.

840
00:59:54,029 --> 00:59:56,141
- On 1, 2, 3.
- On 1, 2, 3.

841
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,122
- No.
- I can't.

842
01:00:03,998 --> 01:00:06,385
- Shoot.
- Got it.

843
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:08,751
Where is it?

844
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:16,025
Stay in position and fire.

845
01:00:16,049 --> 01:00:18,711
- Die.
- Die.

846
01:00:19,558 --> 01:00:20,978
I got one.

847
01:00:24,308 --> 01:00:26,124
I got another one.

848
01:00:26,148 --> 01:00:27,754
Can't you do any better?

849
01:00:29,148 --> 01:00:32,361
I'll reload and try again.

850
01:00:34,569 --> 01:00:35,584
That's hot.

851
01:00:35,608 --> 01:00:38,271
Why would you touch the barrel, you idiot?

852
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:41,765
Kook Young Soo, Lee Soon Yi.

853
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:43,764
- Pull yourselves together.
- Okay.

854
01:00:43,788 --> 01:00:45,988
Start firing.

855
01:00:48,538 --> 01:00:51,256
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

856
01:00:53,128 --> 01:00:54,647
Place it on your soldier.

857
01:00:55,889 --> 01:00:58,155
I have horrible aim.

858
01:00:58,179 --> 01:01:00,155
No. Tae Man!

859
01:01:00,179 --> 01:01:01,825
Help me.

860
01:01:01,849 --> 01:01:03,641
Hurry.

861
01:01:04,478 --> 01:01:06,374
I can't get any of them.

862
01:01:06,398 --> 01:01:08,284
- Jang Soo.
- Yes?

863
01:01:08,308 --> 01:01:10,057
Help us, Jang Soo.

864
01:01:10,688 --> 01:01:12,163
Maintain your positions.

865
01:01:13,779 --> 01:01:16,135
- Where did it go?
- Where are they?

866
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,391
Over there.

867
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,053
Darn it.

868
01:01:20,529 --> 01:01:21,715
I'm out of ammo.

869
01:01:21,739 --> 01:01:24,676
Hand me some now.

870
01:01:25,659 --> 01:01:28,596
- What are you waiting for?
- Are you serious?

871
01:01:34,878 --> 01:01:35,978
What?

872
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:43,569
What is it?

873
01:01:43,679 --> 01:01:45,010
Why aren't they coming out?

874
01:01:45,938 --> 01:01:47,038
I don't know.

875
01:01:48,478 --> 01:01:49,666
Cover me.

876
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:53,869
I don't see them.

877
01:01:55,108 --> 01:01:56,252
What's going on?

878
01:01:58,449 --> 01:01:59,912
Are they going after something?

879
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:07,831
I think they're hiding.

880
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:14,048
- Where are you going?
- We have to find and kill them.

881
01:02:14,378 --> 01:02:17,314
You can't do it alone.

882
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:19,032
- Let go of me.
- What's this?

883
01:02:19,719 --> 01:02:20,985
It's still here.

884
01:02:21,009 --> 01:02:22,109
What?

885
01:02:22,849 --> 01:02:24,115
Where is it?

886
01:02:24,139 --> 01:02:27,534
Behind you!

887
01:02:27,558 --> 01:02:29,714
It's coming.

888
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:39,563
- Where did it come from?
- Where did it come from?

889
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:42,637
- Get it.
- Kill it.

890
01:02:53,628 --> 01:02:54,728
Are you okay?

891
01:03:05,469 --> 01:03:06,494
What are you doing?

892
01:03:06,518 --> 01:03:08,674
Take your positions and search your surroundings.

893
01:03:09,688 --> 01:03:11,954
- Back to your positions.
- Yes, sir.

894
01:03:11,978 --> 01:03:13,221
Yes, sir.

895
01:03:15,188 --> 01:03:16,332
Young Sin.

896
01:03:19,898 --> 01:03:21,054
Cho Young Sin!

897
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:22,666
Locate the sphere.

898
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:30,958
Darn it.

899
01:03:31,668 --> 01:03:33,043
What should we do now?

900
01:03:36,049 --> 01:03:38,105
We'll find every one of them...

901
01:03:38,628 --> 01:03:39,772
and eliminate them all.

902
01:03:41,179 --> 01:03:42,367
Yes, sir.

903
01:03:51,558 --> 01:03:54,451
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

904
01:03:55,688 --> 01:03:56,975
Ladies first.

905
01:03:57,188 --> 01:03:58,519
You go first.

906
01:04:12,038 --> 01:04:13,733
Hey, that way.

907
01:04:13,829 --> 01:04:16,259
Wait. Darn it.

908
01:04:37,268 --> 01:04:38,599
Darn it.

909
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:47,129
No.

910
01:04:50,989 --> 01:04:52,276
What happened?

911
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:54,555
We got one.

912
01:04:54,579 --> 01:04:56,104
We just lost one.

913
01:04:56,128 --> 01:04:57,547
Seriously?

914
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:12,323
Up there.

915
01:05:23,069 --> 01:05:24,300
That scared me.

916
01:05:26,358 --> 01:05:27,458
Na Ra.

917
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:29,339
Let's go.

918
01:05:29,529 --> 01:05:30,959
Come on.

919
01:05:33,409 --> 01:05:35,059
I shouldn't have saved him.

920
01:06:03,108 --> 01:06:04,208
No.

921
01:06:23,128 --> 01:06:24,272
Darn it.

922
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:27,604
Go to the left.

923
01:06:27,628 --> 01:06:28,828
Come with me, Chi Yeol.

924
01:06:38,018 --> 01:06:39,305
I don't believe it.

925
01:06:41,188 --> 01:06:42,244
Na Ra.

926
01:06:42,268 --> 01:06:44,380
Stop whining.

927
01:06:45,529 --> 01:06:48,410
Stop with the whining.

928
01:06:53,529 --> 01:06:54,684
Hey.

929
01:06:55,239 --> 01:06:58,055
It's too dark. Maybe we shouldn't go in.

930
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,845
One was detected.

931
01:07:00,869 --> 01:07:02,111
We have to get it.

932
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:04,551
Take your lantern out.

933
01:07:04,838 --> 01:07:05,938
Okay.

934
01:07:12,338 --> 01:07:15,650
Why am I in the lead?

935
01:07:17,389 --> 01:07:19,155
- Stop that.
- I'm sorry.

936
01:07:19,179 --> 01:07:20,825
- Seriously.
- I'm sorry.

937
01:07:20,849 --> 01:07:23,191
Get it out of my face.

938
01:07:29,398 --> 01:07:30,917
I don't think it's in here.

939
01:07:33,159 --> 01:07:34,710
Careful.

940
01:07:41,748 --> 01:07:42,848
Okay.

941
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,312
- There it is.
- Get it.

942
01:08:03,188 --> 01:08:05,245
I can't see it.

943
01:09:10,209 --> 01:09:11,584
It's getting away.

944
01:09:16,129 --> 01:09:17,283
Hey.

945
01:09:17,589 --> 01:09:18,974
Duk Joong.

946
01:09:19,848 --> 01:09:21,498
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

947
01:09:23,978 --> 01:09:26,164
- I'm alive.
- Yes.

948
01:09:26,188 --> 01:09:27,288
You're okay.

949
01:09:27,938 --> 01:09:29,795
- You scared me.
- Are you okay?

950
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:31,512
I think he's okay.

951
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:35,387
- That scared me.
- I know.

952
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:38,919
Quiet.

953
01:10:51,398 --> 01:10:54,511
(Duty After School)
