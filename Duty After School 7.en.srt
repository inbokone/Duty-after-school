(Lee Chun Ho)

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,000
Catch me if you can

5
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,969
Has it been a month already?

6
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:45,549
(Reservist number 9, Park So Yoon)

7
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:46,929
Since we've been on our own.

8
00:00:46,929 --> 00:00:49,009
Gosh. It feels like only yesterday...

9
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,469
that we were so scared of that little sphere.

10
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:52,679
(Reservist number 3, Kim Duk Joong)

11
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,679
There's something...

12
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,689
(Reservist number 3, Kim Duk Joong)

13
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,229
different about their eyes.

14
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,540
Keep up, you little jerks.

15
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,920
Darn it. Let's go!

16
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Whatever, darn it.

17
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,140
I just catch them. I have no grand plans.

18

(Reservist number 2, Kwon Il Ha)

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,689
I just want to destroy all of those spheres.

20
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,459
Yeon Bo Ra!

21
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,509
Come on. There are so many of them.

22
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,479
Take that, you stupid spheres.

23
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,580
Our shooting skills improved overall.

24
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,580
We're not the same students...

25
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,870
who had their first shooting drill in the range.

26
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,000
(Reservist number 20, Cho Jang Soo)

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,379
If Mr. Lee were to see us now,

28
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:45,550
(Reservist number 20, Cho Jang Soo)

29
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,669
he would be surprised.

30
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,300
Yeon Bo Ra, are you ready?

31
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,930
Hurry up. There are so many of them.

32
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:55,639
Let's go!

33
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,939
I got you!

34
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,939
(Danger)

35
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,110
What?

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Where did it go?

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,939
Darn it. I'm sure it came in here.

38
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,569
Come on. That sly prick. Darn it.

39
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,530
Gosh, this is so annoying.

40
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:18,909
Look at that jerk!

41
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,430
Get it.

42
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,360
Hey, drive steady.

43
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Darn it. Why don't you drive then?

44
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,419
Nothing about this feels real.

45
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,250
Sometimes, it feels like I'm playing Battlegrounds.

46

(Reservist number 11, Yeon Bo Ra)

47
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,379
It feels like this is all a dream.

48
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,759
Hey, I told you to stop!

49
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,810
Gosh. Look at that jerk.

50
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,730
Seriously? That's where you're heading to?

51
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:23,889
Gosh.

52
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,860
Come back here. It's over now. You jerk.

53
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,110
Look at that rat.

54
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,410
Come on.

55
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:43,750
Hide well Or I'll see a glimpse of your head

56
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,250
I wonder where the sphere went.

57
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:50,670
You know what? In your next life, be born as a human.

58
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,750
You punk.

59
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:53,629
With that said...

60
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,339
Goodbye.

61
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:08,939
I'm doomed.

62
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,480
I need help!

63
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:17,860
Guys! I need backup!

64
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,029
Somebody save me!

(Reservist number 7, No Ae Seol)

67
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,910
Other than that, I'm okay.

68
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,620
Help!

69
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,410
It's showtime.

70
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,829
Fire!

71
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,930
Take that!

72
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,839
Die, you jerks!

73
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:27,730
Take that! Die!

74
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,230
I'm so relieved that the CSAT was postponed for a month.

(Reservist number 1, Kook Young Soo)

76

I couldn't study a lot because of the war.

77
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,189
Hey, I thought they got weak in cold environments.

78
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,029
How come they are still so strong?

79
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,199
They're adapting to the weather pretty well. How annoying.

80
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,449
I think we got rid of them all in this area.

81
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,750
Let's do a status report.

82
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,709
- Okay. - Okay.

83
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,500
- I have 2 left. - I have 1 left.

84
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,709
I'm empty.

85
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:56,050
- What? - What?

86
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,509
I mean, I'm out.

87
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,129
I see.

88
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,339
Really?

89
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,050
Then...

90
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,100
my fuel tank is empty too.

91
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,060
And my stomach too.

92
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:10,769
It's empty.

93
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,480
If we're talking about, I'm with you too.

94

- Let's go. - Let's go.

99

I'm heading out first.

Wait for us, Duk Joong.

(Reservist number 13, Woo Hee Rak)

109

Do you know what irritates me the most about this?

110

(Reservist number 13, Woo Hee Rak)

111
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,050
We've adjusted to this new norm now.

112
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,769
You think the spheres are adjusting fast?

113
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:49,970
You guys are adapting much faster!

114
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,100
Don't you think so?

115
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,189
On top of that, you guys are enjoying this!

116

Hey, stop complaining. Okay?

117
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,610
How can anyone enjoy this?

118
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,980
I thought we were the search team.

119
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,110
We already caught three spheres just today.

120
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,399
You call this searching?

121
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:06,449
We must look around to know what we should be careful of.

122
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:08,990
So what have we learned from walking around here?

123
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,160
How much longer must we do this? Darn it!

124
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,250
If we were going to give up now, why come here in the first place?

125
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,879
And besides, do you want to forfeit the extra points we earned so far?

126

Shut your mouth.

You think that gives you the right to speak up?

The radio has to work for us to decide our next step.

130
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,800
Exactly! When will the walkie-talkie get fixed?

131
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,180
We're all going to get killed out here.

132

- Exactly, my point! - "Exactly, my point."

That's enough. You guys are always so grumpy.

- Guys, she... - She said we'd discuss it at home.

What's wrong with you?

139
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,820
I don't care about the CSAT.

140
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,409
I just want to go home.

Gosh. It's home.

147
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,799
- I'm so tired. - Crazy. She called it home.

Hey. You be quiet.

Let's go. Hurry up.

155
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,440
Ridiculous. Do you think we're here on a trip?

156
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,649
We're the only ones here. Why are we doing this every day?

Hey, be quiet.

- Everyone is back, right? - The spheres might hear us.

159

- That nuisance. - Let's go to an easy spot.

160

Let him be. Complaining gets him going.

161
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,750
Dry shampoo!

162
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,000
- We don't have it! - We don't have it!

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,960
What? You said you would get me the dry shampoo.

164
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,750
Why don't you shave your head instead?

165
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,250
Yes. That might be better.

166

Hee Rak, did you get the clam chowder I asked for?

167

Jang Soo, can you put me in raiding party tomorrow?

169
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,850
For the bonus points.

170

- Really? I'll think about it. - Chi Yeol.

171
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,850
- Thanks. - How about...

172
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:55,139
the clam chowder I asked for?

173
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,519
How could I get that in this rural area?

174
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,559
But you promised!

175

Why is he taking it out on me?

176
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,730
- Good job. - I hate the spheres

177
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,990
- I hate them - I really hate them

178
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,320
- I despise them - No

179
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,990
- This is nice. - Right?

- One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four.

186
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,539
Hey. Did you do everything you were supposed to do?

187
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,090
- What? - I don't know.

188
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,210
You guys didn't do it.

189

- What? - You were supposed to fix the leak.

- Right! Darn it. - Right! Darn it.

- Here. - Gosh.

192
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,100

- She's gone mad. - Enough is enough.

196
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,820
You know what I think? She's not sick at all.

197
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,820
She's faking it.

198
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,779
- Gosh. - Girls.

199
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,120
- She's stressing me out. - Gosh.

200
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,539
How come her acting never gets better?

201
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,539
Are you okay?

202
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:02,710
I'm hungry.

203
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,039
Come to think of it,

204
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:08,460
we'll turn 20 in a few days.

307
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,980
Go ask for it if you want to.

- Do you want gochujang? - I want ssamjang.

312
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,700

It's nothing.

You know what?

327
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,180
We only spoke once after becoming classmates.

328
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,970
I asked you about our homework.

329

If it weren't for the war,

330

we wouldn't have spoken like this.

I'm sure we would've graduated without speaking to some classmates.

00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,119
When we go back to school, do you think we can be the same?

335
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,670
Everyone will probably go back to sticking to their groups,

336
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,460
get busy,

337
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,630
prepare for the CSAT,

338
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,509
go to university and lose touch.

339
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,849
Don't you think that's going to happen?

340
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,759
I don't know.

341
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,430
But I don't think so.

342
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:01,440
I want to stay close to the new friends I made.

343
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,269
I see.

344
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:19,619
I should get going.

345
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,339
- You're good. - Impressive.

346
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,390
That's enough.

347
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,559
Look at my wrist.

348
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,890
You're good.

349
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:42,019
How elaborate!

350
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,980
- He's good, right? - Yes, he is.

351
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,059
I know.

352
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,480
Impressive.

353
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:48,779
All right.

354
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,900
Leave my sideburns.

355
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:53,819
Don't worry. It's almost done.

356
00:19:58,829 --> 00:20:00,200
Okay.

357
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:02,660
There.

358
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:04,920
Done!

359
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,000
- Kim Duk Joong. - Nice.

360
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,839
You look different.

361
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:12,049
That's not bad.

362
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,130
It's nice.

363
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:17,140
Good job.

364
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,519
- Seriously. - What is with them?

365
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,349
Cut my hair too.

366
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:25,059
- What? - Just cut it at a hair salon later.

367
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,190
We don't know when we can go.

368
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,609
It's annoying since we can't wash our hair.

369
00:20:29,609 --> 00:20:31,400
- Just cut it off. - Still...

370
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,490
- I'd be sad. - Me too.

371
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,819
Don't complain afterwards.

372
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,279
I won't.

373
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,160
All right then.

374
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,579
- What should we do? - I don't know.

375
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:42,660
I can't watch this.

376
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,460
Men and women have different hair.

377
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,630
- I'll cut it short. - Okay.

378
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,500
Short?

379
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,349
Oh, no.

380
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,980
(Lee Chun Ho)

381
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,609
(Yongdu Service Area)

382
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,660
What's this?

383
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,289
You haven't been talking or eating much.

384
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,250
I was keeping it for myself, but you can have it.

385
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:35,720
Have it and joke around like you used to.

386
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:38,470
I'm not a kid.

387
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:41,720
Do whatever you want with it.

388
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,829
Wild goose.

389
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:05,289
This is Seagull, over.

390
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,210
Wild goose, this is Seagull, over.

391
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:15,710
It isn't working, is it?

392
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,089
It's working, but there's no signal.

393
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,970
Why did it break all of a sudden?

394
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,099
About the radio...

395
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,650
Would we be able to find the parts at that place?

396
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,109
- Where? - Where?

397
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,650
On my way back here after removing the spheres,

398
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,359
I saw a penitentiary.

399
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:40,910
It seemed unharmed as if it didn't suffer any damage.

400
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,410
If we go there, we may find what we need.

401
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,910
What? You didn't go inside and take a look?

402
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,039
What? Oh...

403
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,670
Well, we only had a few bullets left.

404
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,920
And Duk Joong kept saying he was hungry, so we just came back here.

405
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,299
Darn it. He's never helpful.

406
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:01,299
My point exactly.

407
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:02,299
Hold on.

408
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,759
A penitentiary? They must have communications equipment.

409
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,019
We should go there tomorrow.

410
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,680
- Are you in? - Yes, I'm in.

411
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,599
Okay.

412

(Plastic-Free Challenge)

413
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
What is this?

414
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Don't even.

415
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:27,619
Okay.

416
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,579
Done!

417
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
- Oh, my. - Nice job, Duk Joong.

418
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,539
Duk Joong, you're pretty good.

419
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,210
Hey.

420
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,049
Can you give me a haircut too?

421
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
What?

422
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,180
- It looks nice. - Yes.

423
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,099
I want the same haircut as Bo Ra's.

424
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,480
Oh, sure.

425
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,349
- Should I get a haircut too? - No.

426
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:54,769
No!

427
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,910
What's with you, Kimchi?

428
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,740
Who are you to tell her not to do it?

429
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,740
Well...

430
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:12,039
Just because. She already looks so pretty.

431
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:13,039
I don't want her to ruin her hair.

432
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,089
Right, but why are you worried about her hair?

433
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
Well...

434
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
I'm against it too.

435
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,049
I like her hair now.

436
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,059
Soo Chul.

437
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,730
What about me? What kind of hairstyle would suit me?

438
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,190
Well, anything would do.

439
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,309
Come on. Just tell me. What kind of hairstyle?

440
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,279
Hey, flirting is a habit.

441
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,240
I am not flirting.

442
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Ha Na.

443
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,910
Just shave it off. All of it.

444
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Shave it off!

445
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,869
Not a bad idea.

446
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
So?

447
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,539
You want a haircut?

448
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:52,619
Yes, go ahead and cut it.

449
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,210
All right.

450
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,079
- Should I do it too? - If you cut your hair...

451
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,000
Then I'll give you a short haircut like Bo Ra's.

452
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Sure.

453
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Okay.

454
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,849
Don't do it.

455
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,400
My gosh! My scissors are broken.

456
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,940
Can we do it another time?

457
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,650
Oh, really?

458
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,069
Then let's do it another time.

459
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,910
Okay, let me...

460
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,500
Hey, do scissors break?

461
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,119
It can happen.

462
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:37,579
Gosh.

463
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:39,420
I've never heard of scissors breaking.

464
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,049
You little...

465
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,309
The haircut really suits you.

466
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,390
Duk Joong surprised me.

467
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,480
- Right? - Yes.

468
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,940
Hey!

469
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,690
How do I look? Nice, right?

470
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,609
Sure, it's not bad.

471
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,029
You look ugly.

472
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:06,609
Got a death wish?

473
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,240
It's time to vote. Come on, girls.

474
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,779
Young Sin, I've been going easy on you. Do you think I'm a joke?

475
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,329
- Hurry. - You're so dead.

476
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,539
Does everyone have someone but me?

477
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:18,829
What is going on?

478
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,880
I know that some of you are still confused.

479
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,549
Write "O" if you think we should stay here on our own...

480
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:30,180
and "X" if you want to go home.

481
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:32,549
How come you have two?

482
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,470
Hey, this is mine.

483
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,190
Goodness. Let's go home, Bo Ra.

484
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:40,019
- Hey, let's hurry. - Oh, hurry up!

485
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,519
- Hurry. - Goodness.

486
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
Me too.

487
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,779
Give me one too.

488
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,109
Darn it. Of course, I'm submitting X.

489
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:51,950
Everyone will submit X this time, right?

490
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,700
We should go home.

491
00:26:55,369 --> 00:26:57,200
Without some obnoxious jerk, that is.

492
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,420
What?

493
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Hey!

494
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:13,509
Submit X.

495
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,390
You idiot!

496
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,559
That's enough to bribe you?

497
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:20,190
I'm hungry.

498
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:21,849
Gosh, you're such a pig.

499
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,569
Don't exchange looks.

500
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,279
Aren't we done?

501
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,609
Think carefully before you decide.

502
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,569
What for? What is this, a presidential election?

503
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,950
Next.

504
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,950
I'll submit yours for you.

505
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:39,789
Thanks, Soo Chul.

506
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
We will go home. Don't worry.

507
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:04,400
(The 5th Voting Results)

508
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,269
(Stay: 8)

00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,940

00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,400
(Ballot Box)

511
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,490
Stay.

512
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,039
Hey! Seriously.

513
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,039
Cut it out.

514
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,549
- Leave. - Yes!

515
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,799
- Let's go home! - Come on.

516
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,430
Please...

517
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:36,180
- Let's go home already. - Yes, let's go.

518
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:41,980
What is it?

519
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:50,069
- Stay. - Darn it. What?

520
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:52,529
- Darn it! - What?

521
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:54,609
Again? Why?

522
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,740
(Stay: 10, Go home: 9)

523
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,160
What is this? Just why?

524
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,039
Why is this happening every time?

525
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,910
Who voted to stay?

526
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:03,289
What is this?

527
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:06,210
We can't yell at them for not agreeing with us.

528
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,039
- Respect their opinion. - Darn it!

529
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:11,299
I never liked that we had to vote to decide what to do!

530
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,049
That's enough, Hee Rak.

531
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:14,720
- Don't be so petty. - What?

532
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,799
Hey, Park So Yoon. What's petty about wanting to go home?

533
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,390
Why? Is there a reason you don't want to go home?

534
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,940
Do your parents want you to be stuck at home?

535
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,440
Hey, you're dragging my family into this?

536
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,690
Then I must cross the line too.

537
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,980
- Why you little... - What?

538
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,519
- What's your problem? - Hey, girls.

539
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,319
- Hey, calm down! - So Yoon, what's with you?

540
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,440
- Stop. - What?

541
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,609
- You little... - What?

542
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,490
Guys, can't we just leave?

543
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:39,819
I really don't want to be here.

544
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,079
I mean, who keeps voting to stay?

545
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,960
- Who is it? - Who is it?

546
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,460
Hey, Soon Yi. We said we'd never ask.

547
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,380
Well, she's not wrong.

548
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,670
Do you guys not want to go home?

549
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:53,880
What are we doing here?

550
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,299
We said we'd follow the majority opinion.

551
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,680
If you want to go back, you guys can go ahead.

552
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:01,849
Well...

553
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,230
I never said I'd leave now.

554
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,980
You're scared of going alone, aren't you?

555
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,849
Whatever we do, we must do it together...

556
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,400
like the platoon commander said.

557
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,859
He's at it again.

558
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:18,950
Hang in there, guys.

559
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:22,410
We said we'd follow the majority opinion until we fixed the radio.

560
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:25,910
Darn it! We'll all die at this rate!

561
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:28,710
You saw what happened yesterday. Il Ha nearly died.

562
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,829
Let's be honest. We almost died multiple times...

563
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,210
even on our way here.

564
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:34,670
It's a miracle that we're still alive!

565
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,380
No matter what we decide to do, we are in danger.

566
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:39,470
We can't move without accurate information.

567
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,680
That's true.

568
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,059
Whether we follow the orders and continue with the operation...

569
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:45,470
or go back to Seoul,

570
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,309
we need to talk to them first to decide. That's safer.

571
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,230
How long will it take for us to fix it?

572
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,730
We'll go to the penitentiary tomorrow and try to find the parts,

573
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,940
so stop whining. Okay?

574
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:00,450
I know everyone is stressed and exhausted,

575
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:02,200
but let's try to stay strong.

576
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,450
If the platoon commander sees us fighting like this,

577
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:05,910
he won't be happy.

578
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,079
That's right.

579
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,000
You guys keep saying that.

580
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,920
All right, Platoon Two. Time to go to bed.

581
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,710
Don't forget the order for your night duty.

582
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:17,299
You're dismissed.

583
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,630
- Let's go. - We should go home!

584
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,180
It's over. Come on. Let's go.

585
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,839
- Gosh... - I'm sorry.

586
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,259
- Me too. - So many Os!

587
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:25,809
I'll catch these jerks and beat them up to a pulp.

588
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:27,769
- Hey, come on. - How could this happen every time?

589
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:29,480
I have a family too!

590
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,440
- Okay, we heard you. - I have a family too!

591
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,940
- Come on. - You guys are way too optimistic.

592
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,359
You jerks.

593
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,519
Come on.

594
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,490
Why does this happen every time?

595
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,529
The raiding party for Squad One.

596
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:44,740
Kim Yu Jung, Cho Jang Soo, Wang Tae Man, Yeon Bo Ra,

597
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,200
Cho Young Sin, No Ae Seol, Park So Yoon, Woo Hee Rak.

598
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:48,869
Squad Two's search team.

599
00:31:48,869 --> 00:31:51,210
Do Soo Chul, Cha So Yeon, Choi Yeon Ju, Kook Young Soo,

600
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,460
Lee Na Ra, Kim Chi Yeol, Kwon Il Ha, and Yoo Ha Na.

601
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,670
Squad One's raiding party will go to the penitentiary...

602
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,460
and find the parts for the radio. Then on your way back,

603
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,549
take care of the spheres that the detector picked up.

604
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:03,259
Squad Two's search team will go to the hospital...

605
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:05,009
to collect medicine and other supplies that we need.

606
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,720
Those who will stay and stand guard are...

607
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,640
Kim Duk Joong, Lee Soon Yi, and Hong Jun Hee.

608
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,980
All good?

609
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,349
- Yes, ma'am! - Okay!

610
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:13,650
I want to join the raiding party.

611
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,609
You're hurt. Just join the search team today.

612
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:17,400
Can't she and No Ae swap their positions?

613
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,279
Why do you keep sending No Ae to the raiding party?

614
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:21,900
Hey, Ae Seol knows how to hit the mark.

615
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,779
She can shoot better than you. You're too impatient.

616
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,910
What?

617
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:27,079
I can join the raiding party.

618
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:30,039
I want to join the raiding party too, not the search team.

619
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,869
You still have a cold.

620
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,539
You were in the raiding party the whole month. You're overworked.

621
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,079
Join the search team today.

622
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,839
Goodness. This is all pointless.

623
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,470
If things go south, we'll all be in danger.

624
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:44,130
Exactly.

625
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:47,259
Don't let your guard down. Let's stay focused, guys.

626
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,640
- We got this! - Okay!

627
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,769
- Let's be careful. - By the way...

628
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,980
I don't see Ha Na.

629
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,980
- What? - What?

630
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,650
Gosh, Yoo Ha Na...

631
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,569
I'll go get her.

632
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:02,650
My goodness.

633
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,160
Ha Na.

634
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,119
Ha Na?

635
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:13,579
Ha Na.

636
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:16,250
I'm so sorry!

637
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,170
Duk Joong.

638
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:22,339
Yes?

639
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,920
I think I have a fever.

640
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,680
Hey, you were totally fine earlier.

641
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:34,980
You stood guard yesterday too.

642
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:42,690
I'm really sick.

643
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,819
For real?

644
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:47,740
I'm telling you the truth.

645
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,039
You can touch me.

646
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:58,539
Hey, you... I know you're feigning illness.

647
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,500
Touch my forehead.

648
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,219
Ha Na is sick.

649
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,139
Whatever.

650
00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:17,690
Hey, she always pretends to be sick.

651
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:20,860
And her acting is so awkward. Goodness.

652
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:22,400
No!

653
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,489
Gosh.

654
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,820
She really is sick today.

655
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,199
She has a high fever. I think she has a cold.

656
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,489
She must've caught a cold!

657
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,739
Is Ha Na really not feeling well?

658
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:37,369
- Gosh, I can't stand her. - I'm not feeling well either.

659
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:38,500
- I know. - Goodness.

660
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,789
I'll swap with her.

661
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,250
Hey, Lee Soon Yi! Why would you do that?

662
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,590
All right. Then Soon Yi will swap with Ha Na today.

663
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,389
Okay. Get going, Platoon Two!

664
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,639
- You got this! - We got this!

665
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,849
Go!

666
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:59,730
Go!

667
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,059
Let's go.

668
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,230
(Happy Correctional Institution, Happy Citizens)

669
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:18,159
(Building 2)

670
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,639
Nothing.

671
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:36,309
My gosh. This is my first time entering a prison.

672
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:37,429
As if it's my second time.

673
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,019
First, let's look for the parts for the radio.

674
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:41,940
We need to find a circuit board that looks like a card.

675
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,230
If you see anything that looks similar, show me or Young Sin.

676
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,570
It'll either be in the guards' office or the control room.

677
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,900
Let's split up and look for it.

678
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,789
Hey, for real?

679
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:03,210
- Let's look for it together. - Come on.

680
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:05,630
Darn it. Open sesame!

681
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:24,059
(Wing 2)

682
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,030
Nothing, right?

683
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,110
Let's go that way.

684
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,420
Are we almost there yet?

685
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,260
No, hang in there just a little longer.

686
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,630
How much longer?

687
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:57,260
You should've just stayed behind if you were going to whine like this.

688
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,849
Why did you swap with her?

689
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,179
So I could take it easy tomorrow!

690
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:04,849
The second day hurts the most. That's why.

691
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:07,980
Give me your bag. Let me carry it for you.

692
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,820
Are you sure?

693
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,690
Thanks.

694
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,650
What if Na Ra decides to go out with him?

695
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,489
She has no reason to reject him.

696
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:27,880
(Last night)

697
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,800
Chili? Veggies? Jjajang?

698
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,429
Chili? Jjajang?

699
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:43,559
Hey, hurry up. What if someone shows up?

700
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:46,730
Darn it. Forget the operation.

701
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:48,059
We must eat to survive.

702
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,309
We'll starve to death at this rate.

703
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,480
Everyone will find out tomorrow.

704
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,489
They're very thorough, you know.

705
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:58,909
Guys, let's just go back!

706
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,199
Yes, I have to pee.

707
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:04,409
I'm sure we'll get caught.

708
00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:06,869
Come on. We won't get caught if we only take 2 or 3.

709
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,710
Everyone will assume they fell down or something.

710
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Darn it. I never liked this idea.

711
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,750
We should've just gone straight back to Seoul.

712
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,630
You're all obsessed with college.

713
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,670
What are you doing?

714
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,340
- Gosh! - Darn it.

715
00:38:18,969 --> 00:38:20,010
Oh, no!

716
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,219
Done with the inventory check? Then let's go.

717
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:26,980
Gosh.

718
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:29,559
- Yes. - All right.

719
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,820
Okay, let's go. Come on, guys.

720
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:37,820
Hey!

721
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:41,409
Gosh, what do we do?

722
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,659
What do we do now?

723
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:49,369
We're in trouble.

724
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:51,210
Come on.

725
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,460
(National Tax Service Metropolitan Counseling Center)

726
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,639
Where were you?

727
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,969
- Did you steal something? - What?

728
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:08,139
I was just asking. Why are you so surprised?

729
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:14,650
You see...

730
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,690
I'm...

731
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:23,199
I keep feeling anxious these days.

732
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:25,329
What? Why are you anxious?

733
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,539
Why? Did something happen?

734
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,250
No. For some reason, I feel like today is the last day...

735
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,579
we can be at ease like this.

736
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,710
Weirdo. Don't make such an ominous remark.

737
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,090
So I want to tell her today.

738
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,630
What?

739
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:52,230
I'll ask Na Ra to be my girlfriend when the war is over.

740
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:53,940
- What? - What did you say?

741
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,940
You mean, Lee Na Ra?

742
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,030
You like Lee Na Ra?

743
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,440
Yes. Didn't I tell you?

744
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,949
My goodness.

745
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,159
Hey, you've got a quirky taste in women.

746
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,289
Hey, Do Soo Chul!

747
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,789
So you'll confess your feelings to her in this situation?

748
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,000
I know for a fact that she'll think you're crazy.

749
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,170
Don't you think it's actually a good opportunity?

750
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:22,679
"Opportunity?"

751
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:27,349
Just like me, she might be thinking that today is our last day.

752
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:30,309
In times like this,

753
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:32,559
you become sentimental.

754
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:35,980
Yes, that's true.

755
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,400
- She might say yes right away. - Yes, exactly.

756
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,320
Young Soo, you've never dated anyone. What do you even know?

757
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,909
I read in the column that it's easier to win over women...

758
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:47,829
who seem to be the quiet, stern type.

759
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:50,369
- The column? Whatever. - Kimchi, you've never dated either.

760
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:56,420
Gosh.

761
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,550
Just pray for me, guys.

762
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,510
Hey, you'll tell her now?

763
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:08,510
For real?

764
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:15,230
Gosh, darn it.

765
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,440
My toes are so itchy that I can't sleep.

766
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,519
It's because you had frostbite and warmed them up right away.

767
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,190
We'll find medicine for you at the hospital tomorrow. Hang in there.

768
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,369
Gosh, my atopic dermatitis is acting up too. This is driving me nuts!

769
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:29,409
Hey, stop scratching.

770
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,659
Me too. I feel itchy too.

771
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,250
Hey, that's the athlete's foot.

772
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:37,630
No, it's not.

773
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:40,460
- Hey. - Darn you. You scared me.

774
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,170
My gosh, Sorry...

775
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,800
Hey, I'm sorry.

776
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,550
What? You're such a loser.

777
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:55,059
Hey, can you get Na Ra for me?

778
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,519
- Na Ra? - Yes.

779
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,059
I have to ask her something.

780
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,070
- Na Ra. - Yes.

781
00:42:06,449 --> 00:42:09,070
Gosh, this is nuts.

782
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:12,869
We can't go out there and mess it up.

783
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:14,699
Hush, be quiet.

784
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,710
- Why did you want to talk to me? - What?

785
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,170
Well, what was it?

786
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,389
Well...

787
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:34,559
Shoot... What can I do to shoot better?

788
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:39,190
That idiot. That was so lame.

789
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,900
What? You want to know how you can become better at shooting?

790
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,989
Yes, I was just curious.

791
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,699
Jang Soo is a good shooter too.

792
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,119
Jang Soo? Right, he is.

793
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,539
Jang Soo is asleep. He went to bed early. He was snoring.

794
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,880
- Hey. - Yes?

795
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,090
At this rate, he won't even be able to bring it up. Right?

796
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,210
Totally.

797
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,050
Goodness. Soo Chul is such a sissy.

798
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,389
Well...

799
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,230
My shots are the most accurate when I'm not nervous.

800
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:21,730
I can't shoot well when I'm nervous.

801
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,110
So you're saying...

802
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,570
Don't... Don't be nervous.

803
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:31,360
That's your point, right?

804
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:32,949
- Hey. - Yes.

805
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:36,119
- It's game over. - That's what I think.

806
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:38,250
It's game over.

807
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,090
Oh, thank you.

808
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:51,050
No problem.

809
00:43:52,889 --> 00:43:54,679
It's getting late. Thanks.

810
00:43:56,179 --> 00:43:58,309
- Good night. - Night.

811
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:00,349
Go. Leave.

812
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:02,980
Yes!

813
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,809
- I told you to trust me. - Thank goodness.

814
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,400
Hey, Na Ra.

815
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,400
Yes?

816
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:21,539
We'll go back to school once the war is over, you know.

817
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:23,500
Yes.

818
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:27,880
Well... If we manage to return safe and sound,

819
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,340
will you be my girlfriend?

820
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,920
What?

821
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,929
Darn it. We're doomed.

822
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,510
Why?

823
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:41,230
What do you mean, why?

824
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:44,190
Na Ra, you transferred to our school...

825
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,019
and to my class when we were juniors.

826
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:49,570
I've had feelings for you since then.

827
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
What?

828
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:53,110
Oh.

829
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:54,820
Right.

830
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:56,739
Are you surprised?

831
00:44:58,409 --> 00:45:00,869
I'm not asking you to go out with me immediately.

832
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I'm just saying...

833
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:04,750
if we go back to school,

834
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,170
let's study together...

835
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,460
and hang out.

836
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,130
I...

837
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,679
Hey.

838
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:18,719
Stop it.

839
00:45:22,269 --> 00:45:23,980
- I am... - You don't...

840
00:45:25,769 --> 00:45:27,230
You don't have to answer me right now.

841
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,230
If someone called me out suddenly...

842
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,070
and said something like this, I'd be flustered too.

843
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,159
Give it some thought before answering.

844
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,619
Just don't make me wait for too long.

845
00:46:03,269 --> 00:46:04,269
Is she interested in someone else?

846
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:07,349
Could it be me?

847
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,869
- Hey. - Our eyes met again.

848
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,159
Come to think of it,

849
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,460
my eyes often met Na Ra's.

850
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,960
Could she be interested in me?

851
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,880
It's the hospital.

852
00:46:37,469 --> 00:46:38,840
Hurry up, Young Soo.

Are there spheres?

856
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,079
No.

857
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,250
Let's spread out.

858
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:33,980
Did you hear that?

859
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:40,489
Let's check it out.

860
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:47,949
I saw something like this.

861
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,500
What was that sound?

862
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,840
Hey.

863
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,590
Let's go outside.

864
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:09,730
- Did you hear that sound? - Yes.

865
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,110
What was it?

866
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:19,190
- Did you hear that? - Yes.

867
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,820
- Where is the sound coming from? - What could it be?

868
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,780
What is it? Could it be a sphere?

869
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:29,449
No, it isn't.

870
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:31,750
Then what is it? It's giving me the creeps.

871
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,119
I hear it again.

872
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,500
Wait a second.

873
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,590
Listen closely.

874
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,300
What is it?

875
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:45,340
I know this.

876
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:48,219
It's an SOS signal.

877
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:51,269
Beep, beep, beep.

878
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:52,849

Didn't you watch that movie?

881
00:48:58,269 --> 00:48:59,269
No way.

882
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,280
Do you mean there is someone here?

883
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:06,550
Hey.

884
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,300
I think it's coming from down there.

885
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:09,929
Is there really someone there?

886
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,260
Everyone be careful.

887
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,519
What do you mean "be careful"? We should just go home.

888
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,440
Wait.

889
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,480
Come on.

890
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:21,480
- Let's go. - Wait.

891
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,320
No.

892
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,070
What are you doing?

893
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,139
No.

894
00:50:58,139 --> 00:50:59,139
Who are you?

895
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:03,769
- Let go. - Let go right now.

896
00:51:06,739 --> 00:51:07,739
Are you okay?

897
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,030
Who is out there?

898
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:11,739
Open this door.

899
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,030
Help us.

900
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,699
- Let us out. - Help us.

901
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:16,449
- Who is it? - Let us out.

So Yoon got over her cold,

905
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,800
but Il Ha caught it from her, so we need cold medicine.

906

Jun Hee is struggling with frostbite,

907
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:34,889
so we need something to treat that.

910

What? Not at all.

911
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:42,730
No?

Young Soo is still studying hard.

913
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,070
So Yoon doesn't seem to be able to sleep nowadays.

914
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:51,739
I'll have to talk to her tomorrow.

- What else? - Wow.

Chi Yeol, when you record us,

919
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:08,420
you seem to take more footage of Na Ra than the others.

Don't worry.

I won't tell anyone.
