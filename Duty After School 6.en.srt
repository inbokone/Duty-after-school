00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:21,952
It's okay now. All the spheres have been killed.

4
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:26,262
What happened?

5
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:46,090
Is this...

6
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:48,971
a dream?

7
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:04,162
I think they also have survivors.

8
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:10,238
There are boys too.

9
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:11,858
- I told you.
- They have many people.

10
00:01:11,882 --> 00:01:13,445
Don't step on her.

11
00:01:16,312 --> 00:01:18,095
Don't step on her.

12
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:20,295
Hey.

13
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:24,912
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:30,604
Don't step on my friend.

00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:33,678
Don't step on her.

00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:36,819
My friend...

17
00:01:37,583 --> 00:01:40,519
Don't step on my friend.

18
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:42,380
Don't step on her!

19
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:46,705
Don't step on her!

20
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:51,533
Oh, gosh.

21
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:57,405

Darn it.

29
00:02:34,132 --> 00:02:36,344
- Gosh.
- Here...

30
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:39,673

Mr. Lee.

33
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:49,923
There are no signs of spheres.

34
00:02:58,162 --> 00:02:59,307

Gosh.

37
00:03:58,303 --> 00:03:59,953
It stinks.

38
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:27,937
Any survivors?

39
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:36,796
It seems everyone's dead here.

40
00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:38,739
I don't think there are any survivors.

41
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:41,149
I wonder if my parents are okay.

42
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:53,940
Guys, check this place.

43
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,920
This must've been a dormitory.

44
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,081
You kids are...

45
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:34,179
the only survivors.

46
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:39,960
We were told to deliver supplies to the shelter.

47
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:43,844
But when we arrived...

48
00:05:47,412 --> 00:05:49,755
- What about the person in charge?
- We don't know.

49
00:05:50,753 --> 00:05:51,896
He disappeared.

50
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:53,814
Why did you stay here...

51
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,558
without the commander in charge?

52
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:00,322
We were told to wait.

53
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:04,263
That's why we waited.

54
00:06:04,972 --> 00:06:06,810
We did as we were told.

55
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:10,715
So why...

56
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:25,674
It must be very hard,

57
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:27,494
but please calm down.

58
00:06:30,453 --> 00:06:32,389
We'll talk again once things are sorted out.

59
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,183
Okay...

60
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:43,372
Yu Jung, take care of them.

61
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:45,402
Okay.

62
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:56,785
Aren't you hungry?

63
00:06:57,193 --> 00:06:58,568
Do you want something to eat?

64
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:22,105
- One, two, three.
- All right.

65

Kim Dong Hoon, a senior at Hamil High School.

(Hamil High School, Senior Kim Dong Hoon)

70
00:07:58,672 --> 00:08:01,511
- Jang Seung Hee.
- Jang...

71
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:13,497
Did you...

72
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:15,842
see her eyes earlier?

73
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,239
They were unfocused.

74
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:22,839
Completely blank.

75
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:27,813
It is just dreadful.

76
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,705
If I had been left alone,

77
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:37,459
would I have become like them?

78
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,596
Will we be able to survive?

79
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:09,957
This small-sized shelter...

80
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:13,163
was devastated as if there was a surprise attack.

81
00:09:15,332 --> 00:09:16,928
Shelters were set up in the outskirts of the city...

82
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:19,479
where medium spheres don't appear in the first place.

83
00:09:19,503 --> 00:09:22,660
Besides, there are no traces of medium spheres falling.

84
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:26,697
I wonder how this place was raided by smaller spheres.

85
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:31,001
Spheres looking for prey swarmed in here.

86
00:09:33,093 --> 00:09:35,898
How did they know that the shelter was here?

87
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:40,675
Mr. Lee.

88
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:45,668
Ae Seol might cause big trouble at this rate.

89
00:09:45,692 --> 00:09:48,918
She was already weird, but it's gotten worse now.

90
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:50,549
Something might actually happen.

91
00:09:51,952 --> 00:09:54,515
Don't worry about her.

92
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:57,888
She's doing good enough, and she will continue to do so.

93
00:09:57,912 --> 00:10:00,530
You don't know much about her.

94
00:10:02,212 --> 00:10:04,093
Just don't regret it later.

95
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:10,966
It's because of No Ae Seol, that darn wench.

96
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:17,573
Bo Ra.

97
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:28,839
There are no spheres.

98
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:32,758
There are no spheres.

99
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:33,971
No spheres.

100
00:10:35,113 --> 00:10:36,311
Gosh.

101
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,916
This is too bad.

102
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:46,118
I heard their commander-in-chief ran away.

103
00:10:47,172 --> 00:10:51,319
Thank goodness, we have Mr. Lee.

104
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:52,443
I know.

105
00:10:56,763 --> 00:11:00,162
You must be starving. Eat up.

106
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,248
- No way.
- Hey.

107
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,813
What are you doing?

108
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:03,472
Why are you holding a rifle?

109
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:18,098
What are you doing?

110
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:20,156
I...

111
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:23,820
ran away.

112
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:27,073
My friends...

113
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:31,912
They asked me for help.

114
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,753
But I...

115
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:38,131
ran away alone.

116
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:42,848
They all died.

117
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:45,897
No.

118
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:49,913
It's not your fault.

119
00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:52,596
It was the same for me.

120
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:55,629
When my friends died,

121
00:12:57,093 --> 00:12:59,018
I was busy running away.

122
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:04,899
It's never your fault.

123
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:12,378
Please put the rifle down.

124
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:14,266
It's dangerous, that's why.

125
00:13:17,692 --> 00:13:18,792
Yoon Seo.

126
00:13:30,412 --> 00:13:32,073
Please put the rifle down.

127
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,473
Don't come close.

128
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:41,791
Your name...

129
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:44,248
is Yoon Seo, right?

130
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:47,079
Yes.

131
00:13:47,103 --> 00:13:48,665
I know...

132
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:53,225
you've suffered a lot in fear.

133
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:58,813
From now on,

134
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:02,648
we'll protect you.

135
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:06,843
Put down...

136
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:09,486
the rifle.

137
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:14,027
Yoon Seo.

138
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:16,775
Please put the gun down.

139
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:19,107
Please...

140
00:14:36,273 --> 00:14:38,241
You said it was okay.

141
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:46,218
That we just had to do as we were told.

142
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:51,045
That we should wait.

143
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:55,941
I know you'll run away again.

144
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,186
- Yoon Seo.
- Stop.

145
00:14:58,003 --> 00:14:59,146
Extra points?

146
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:04,418
What's the big deal about all that?

147
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:07,677
It's merely nothing!

148
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:12,731
I don't believe you anymore. Because of you people...

149
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:16,172
Because of you adults, everyone died.

150
00:15:16,903 --> 00:15:18,509
My friends...

151
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,506
They're all dead.

152
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:25,219
You killed them all!

153
00:15:25,243 --> 00:15:26,343
No!

154
00:15:29,243 --> 00:15:31,008
- What was that?
- Darn it.

155
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:32,187
What was that sound?

156
00:15:32,202 --> 00:15:34,268
- What?
- Wasn't that a gunshot?

157
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,140
- Hold on.
- Was it shot in this building?

158
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:40,202
Darn it.

159
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:55,632
Won Bin.

160
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:57,920
Won Bin.

161
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:07,850
- Gosh.
- What do we do?

162
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:10,888
Wake up, Won Bin.

163
00:16:10,912 --> 00:16:12,101
Kim Won Bin!

164
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:13,810
Here.

165
00:16:17,253 --> 00:16:19,349
- Mr. Kim...
- Go get the blood-stopper!

166
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:21,229
- Yeon Ju, the blood-stopper!
- Won Bin.

167
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:23,046
Quickly!

168
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:24,189
- Oh, my!
- Go get it quickly.

169
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:26,281
Darn it.

170
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:29,328
Darn.

171
00:16:30,093 --> 00:16:32,480
Hang in there.

172
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:36,632
No...

173
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:41,074
It's not my fault.

174
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:45,575
The adults...

175
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:49,648
The adults are to blame.

176
00:16:51,032 --> 00:16:52,914
It's not my fault.

177
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:58,083
It's not my fault. It's not...

178
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:06,312
It's not my fault.

179
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:12,167
No...

180
00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:41,870
(Duty After School)

181
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:47,651
Wild goose, this is seagull, over.

182
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:54,259
Wild goose, this is seagull, over.

183
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:15,034
He...

184
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,244
Is he asleep?

185
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,043
Mr. Lee.

186
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:28,248
Is he okay?

187
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:30,472
Fortunately, the bullet went through his shoulder.

188
00:19:31,113 --> 00:19:32,509
He's not going to die.

189
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,299
Oh, goodness.

190
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:37,304
But he needs to be treated as soon as possible.

191
00:19:42,952 --> 00:19:44,833
I'm all good,

192
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:47,599
so don't worry.

193
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:50,398
Won Bin, are you okay?

194
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,447
Gosh, I'm telling you I am.

195
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:03,498
- Don't get up.
- Thank you.

196
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:04,798
You guys should go now.

197
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:07,613
- Duk Joong, what time is it?
- What?

198
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:11,008
It's 10pm.

199
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,339
It's time to give him painkillers.

200
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:16,113
Leave that to me. Thanks.

201
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:19,718
I'm not going. I want to stay by his side.

202
00:20:19,742 --> 00:20:22,138
- Let's just go already.
- Why?

203
00:20:22,162 --> 00:20:24,928
- Are you sure he's okay?
- He will be all right.

204
00:20:24,952 --> 00:20:26,558
I don't want to go.

205
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:27,861
Gosh.

206
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:37,142
Oh, goodness. Mr. Lee...

207
00:20:37,262 --> 00:20:39,870
Please do it gently.

208
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:42,787
I'm already holding myself back from wanting to throw you a punch.

209
00:20:43,813 --> 00:20:46,057
You were in no position to take that bullet for me.

210
00:20:52,153 --> 00:20:54,121
If something bad happens to you,

211
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:57,047
the kids will be left without you.

212
00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:00,679
I can't take care of them alone.

213
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:10,802
Don't blame...

214
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:13,309
that girl too much.

215
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:17,696
She must've been...

216
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:19,731
confused and terrified.

217
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:23,779
She'd believed that the adults would protect her,

218
00:21:24,603 --> 00:21:26,253
so she must've felt betrayed.

219
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:31,641
I used to be like them as well.

220
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,842
Then now what?

221
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,930
I'll do the best I can.

222
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:47,379
How did it go?

223
00:21:48,623 --> 00:21:49,810
How's Mr. Kim?

224
00:21:52,543 --> 00:21:53,643
He's all right.

225
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:56,760
- Goodness.
- What a relief.

226
00:22:01,512 --> 00:22:04,537
Guys, what if they end up...

227
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:05,948
shooting us too?

228
00:22:05,972 --> 00:22:08,403
Hey, lower your voice.

229
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:10,866
They might hear you.

230
00:22:12,603 --> 00:22:13,703
Gosh.

231
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:16,589
I'm just anxious, that's why.

232
00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:18,857
You really need to watch your tongue.

233
00:22:18,903 --> 00:22:22,807
But I understand her in a sense.

234
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,173
It was like she took the words...

235
00:22:26,202 --> 00:22:28,216
right out of my mouth.

236
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:46,995
Mr. Lee wants to see us all.

237
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:50,908
As soon as the sun rises tomorrow, we will withdraw...

238
00:22:50,932 --> 00:22:51,998
and return to the camp.

239
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:54,119
- What?
- Can we do that?

240
00:22:54,143 --> 00:22:55,297
What about the mission?

241
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:57,699
I can't guarantee your safety here.

242
00:22:58,063 --> 00:23:01,462
We can't even figure out how many spheres are out there.

243
00:23:01,573 --> 00:23:04,092
And if they attack us all together,

244
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:06,928
we won't be able to handle them.

245
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,296
Look, Mr. Lee.

246
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,309
With what happened last time,

247
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,039
won't you get in trouble if you keep disobeying orders?

248
00:23:14,123 --> 00:23:17,015
I've just decided that your safety is the current priority.

249
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:19,014
I'll take responsibility.

250
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:22,333
Don't worry.

251
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:25,479
The sentinels should make sure to keep guard on alert.

252
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,008
The rest should go to bed.

253
00:23:27,343 --> 00:23:30,829
We'll take off right when the morning comes.

254
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:33,286
That's all.

255
00:23:35,143 --> 00:23:37,379
- What?
- But...

256
00:23:37,403 --> 00:23:39,668
- Gosh, why must we go back?
- He can't just go like that.

257
00:23:39,692 --> 00:23:40,708
- It was hard to come here.
- We're going back?

258
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:43,379
- My gosh.
- If we just go like this...

259
00:23:43,403 --> 00:23:45,839
- Are we really going back?
- Just like this?

260
00:23:45,863 --> 00:23:47,007
Let's go.

261
00:23:49,873 --> 00:23:51,974
If this is what happened to a shelter,

262
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,527
I wonder what happened...

263
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:57,426
to our school.

264
00:24:00,793 --> 00:24:02,267
But if we go back,

265
00:24:03,252 --> 00:24:05,508
won't Mr. Lee get punished?

266
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:10,158
- What if he goes to the guardhouse?
- The guardhouse?

267
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,976
This is worth the death penalty for sure.

268
00:24:13,393 --> 00:24:16,143
- Death penalty?
- No way.

269
00:24:16,643 --> 00:24:17,841
Hey.

270
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:19,713
Stop, or you might jinx it.

271
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:24,339
Come to think of it, Mr. Lee's quite disobedient.

272
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,244
That's because of us.

273
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:28,078
By the way,

274
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,265
what will happen with extra points if we fail our mission?

275
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:35,769
Darn you.

276
00:24:35,793 --> 00:24:38,454
We have to clear the mission to get extra points.

277
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:42,492
His nonsense is so darn consistent.

278
00:24:42,922 --> 00:24:45,188
But if they don't send us to our parents...

279
00:24:45,212 --> 00:24:47,648
for not clearing the mission?

280
00:24:47,672 --> 00:24:51,621
Is that actually your concern when someone's to be executed?

281
00:24:52,222 --> 00:24:54,610
Well, I was just saying...

282
00:24:54,682 --> 00:24:56,002
Let's look on the bright side.

283
00:24:56,893 --> 00:25:00,699
It's good that we're returning from this dangerous situation.

284
00:25:03,482 --> 00:25:07,838
Culprits are bound to be at a crime scene.

285
00:25:09,202 --> 00:25:10,666
("Dr. Frost")

286
00:25:12,823 --> 00:25:14,021
Hold on.

287
00:25:14,242 --> 00:25:15,442
What the?

288
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:17,302
My Coke.

289
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:21,438
I swear I put it in here.

290
00:25:21,462 --> 00:25:22,519
- What?
- Gosh.

291
00:25:22,543 --> 00:25:23,859
- So Yoon.
- What?

292
00:25:23,883 --> 00:25:26,720
- Was it you?
- What are you saying? I'm innocent!

293
00:25:27,803 --> 00:25:29,222
What are you looking at?

294
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:35,311
I think that punk already drank it.

295
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:38,329
Darn, who took it?

296
00:25:38,353 --> 00:25:41,329
- Hey. Goodness! Where is it?
- What are you doing?

297
00:25:41,353 --> 00:25:43,579
- Move. Where did it go?
- Are you kidding me?

298
00:25:43,603 --> 00:25:45,248
Knock it off, you punk.

299
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:48,309
- What is the matter with you?
- Did you see it? Where did it go?

300
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,227
So Yeon.

301
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:10,188
You should be asleep. Why aren't you in bed?

302
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:15,250
Well, the thing is...

303
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:22,158
I'm worried about the return.

304
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:23,976
It's not yours to concern.

305
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:28,134
You came to say that?

306
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:30,003
Pardon?

307
00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:37,228
Actually,

308
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:42,393
I have something to tell you.

309
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:44,151
What is it?

310
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:48,698
Mr. Lee.

311
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:53,508
The truth is, I...

312
00:26:54,383 --> 00:26:56,131
- Duk Joong.
- Good heavens!

313
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:59,381
- What are you doing?
- Well, I...

314
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:01,601
I'm off to the bathroom.

315
00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:04,620
- Go on.
- Thank you...

316
00:27:08,442 --> 00:27:09,630
Gosh.

317
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:15,019
What are you waiting for? Go on now.

318
00:27:16,113 --> 00:27:19,875
This requires a great deal of focus.

319
00:27:29,543 --> 00:27:30,951
What is it that you have to say?

320
00:27:38,843 --> 00:27:41,098
It's nothing. Goodnight.

321
00:28:13,172 --> 00:28:14,691
(Woo Hee Rak)

322
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:16,530
"Woo Hee Rak"?

323
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:17,883
I wonder how it went.

324
00:28:18,182 --> 00:28:20,198
Kim Duk Joong, that pooper.

325
00:28:20,222 --> 00:28:22,841
- She's back.
- This is so annoying.

326
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:26,222
Did you tell him how you feel?

327
00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:30,958
No, I don't think the time is right.

328
00:28:30,982 --> 00:28:32,918
- Gosh.
- My friend's helpless.

329
00:28:32,942 --> 00:28:34,911
Goodness.

330
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:37,250
I'll do it when we return.

331
00:28:37,992 --> 00:28:39,873
I don't get why you like him.

332
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,096
Gosh.

333
00:28:44,543 --> 00:28:45,774
You see it's bound...

334
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,559
to get beautiful when you fall in love during a time of war.

335
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:51,289
What are you saying? Gosh, you're insane.

336
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:13,511
Na Ra, there's no need to do that much.

337
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:14,972
Okay?

338
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:16,757
Oh, right.

339
00:29:17,492 --> 00:29:20,242
Get some sleep while I keep watch.

340
00:29:20,403 --> 00:29:21,557
I'm okay.

341
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:25,963
I see.

342
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:33,988
Should I tell her now?

343
00:29:36,422 --> 00:29:40,327
No, she'll think I'm a psycho if I tell her at this time.

344
00:29:45,103 --> 00:29:46,290
Still,

345
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:50,288
it's just us here. This might be a chance to tell her.

346
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:56,449
- Look.
- What?

347
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:00,980
Well...

348
00:30:02,662 --> 00:30:04,489
Na Ra, do you perhaps...

349
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:08,696
have someone...

350
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:14,499
Do you perhaps have...

351
00:30:16,922 --> 00:30:18,485
a celebrity you like?

352
00:30:24,932 --> 00:30:26,670
- I see spheres.
- What?

353
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:33,168
The detector doesn't show anything.

354
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:34,975
They're outside its radar.

355
00:30:35,353 --> 00:30:37,014
About 2km away from here.

356
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:39,550
Let me see.

357
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:15,104
Are you saying they exchanged signals?

358
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:24,065
We're not exactly sure,

359
00:31:24,202 --> 00:31:26,468
but a giant sphere gave out light in the sky.

360
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:30,342
Then a boss sphere emitted light as well.

361
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:31,819
After that,

362
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,059
they went somewhere.

363
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,150
It seemed like they were communicating.

364
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:38,999
So they're showing...

365
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:42,791
a pattern where a few go somewhere...

366
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:45,609
and come back...

367
00:31:46,093 --> 00:31:50,129
after exchanging signals.

368
00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:53,816
Maybe they're looking for something.

369
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:56,999
- Could it be...
- Scouting.

370
00:31:57,903 --> 00:31:59,090
Scouting?

371
00:31:59,313 --> 00:32:02,293
Yes, it's as if they're scouting.

372
00:32:03,283 --> 00:32:04,888
They're checking where people went.

373
00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:08,530
They're smarter than we think.

374
00:32:16,912 --> 00:32:18,936
They went somewhere around here and came back.

375
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:24,508
What's there?

376
00:32:24,633 --> 00:32:26,789
I heard a shelter was there.

377
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:28,738
Our platoon commander said so.

378
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:31,557
That a small-sized shelter was there.

379
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:33,289
Hold on a second.

380
00:32:33,472 --> 00:32:37,697
Then does it mean they got an order from the giant sphere...

381
00:32:38,313 --> 00:32:41,879
and decided on a nearby shelter as their next target?

382
00:32:41,903 --> 00:32:43,879
No way.

383
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:45,146
Because it has...

384
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:48,255
a lot to prey on.

385
00:32:48,823 --> 00:32:52,221
- Pardon?
- People gathered to find shelter,

386
00:32:52,873 --> 00:32:55,579
but it ended up becoming a place full of prey.

387
00:32:57,452 --> 00:32:59,168
And it got much easier for the spheres.

388
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:04,688
- Gosh.
- We better inform them quickly,

389
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:06,142
but the communications are down.

390
00:33:07,012 --> 00:33:08,201
What do we do?

391
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:20,001
We will...

392
00:33:20,853 --> 00:33:22,964
withdraw tomorrow morning as planned.

393
00:33:24,522 --> 00:33:25,722
Okay.

394
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:26,799
What about the shelter?

395
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:28,934
The number is too many.

396
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:32,329
Let's return as soon as possible and come up with another way.

397
00:33:33,162 --> 00:33:36,550
What if the spheres attack them before then?

398
00:33:37,452 --> 00:33:40,896
Given their speed, it'll be too late when the backup force arrives.

399
00:33:41,712 --> 00:33:43,451
What are you trying to say?

400
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:45,359
There's nothing much we can do.

401
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:48,726
Right, we have to follow orders.

402
00:33:49,212 --> 00:33:52,238
We can't go home until we kill all the spheres, no?

403
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:54,158
You know what happened to the Hamil High students.

404
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:55,514
You don't want to die, do you?

405
00:33:56,722 --> 00:33:59,758
Right, it's too dangerous.

406
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:03,645
Soon Yi. You're scared too, right?

407
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:05,792
I'm scared.

408
00:34:08,073 --> 00:34:09,261
But...

409
00:34:09,903 --> 00:34:12,796
someone's parents might be there.

410
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:15,452
Who's going to protect them?

411
00:34:27,752 --> 00:34:31,746
If we go, other students will come.

412
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:35,076
Sungjin High instead of Hamil High.

413
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,837
And another high after that.

414
00:34:49,903 --> 00:34:51,046
Gosh.

415
00:34:54,363 --> 00:34:57,806
I guess it's decided.

416
00:35:41,243 --> 00:35:44,641
- Thank you.
- You make me smile.

417
00:35:50,252 --> 00:35:51,408
Doesn't it feel like...

418
00:35:52,053 --> 00:35:54,153
the kids somehow became so mature?

419
00:35:55,303 --> 00:35:57,822
Gosh, I feel so proud.

420
00:36:00,053 --> 00:36:03,957
Maybe this is how a parent feels to watch their child grow.

421
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:12,184
Be honest with me. How old are you?

422
00:36:12,732 --> 00:36:13,832
I'm 41.

423
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:22,272
It's a different spot.

424
00:36:27,082 --> 00:36:30,713
We're going to get busy. Stay focused.

425
00:36:32,252 --> 00:36:35,608
What are you talking about? I'm a patient.

426
00:36:38,803 --> 00:36:39,947
There are no exceptions.

427
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:46,409
- Sir, you're too mean.
- You heard me.

428
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:47,533
Oh, please.

429
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,372
Attention.

430
00:36:50,192 --> 00:36:52,589
The spheres are scattered near the neighbourhood,

431
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:56,419
and it's too dangerous to find and kill them 1-by-1.

432
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:58,312
Right.

433
00:36:58,533 --> 00:36:59,721
So we will...

434
00:37:01,163 --> 00:37:04,463
gather the spheres here at Maesong City University...

435
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:06,478
and get rid of them all at once.

436
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:08,938
- What? How?
- How will we do that?

437
00:37:08,962 --> 00:37:10,438
- At once?
- How?

438
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,938
- Is that even possible?
- How?

439
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:14,062
From now on,

440
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:17,018
listen carefully to what I say.

441
00:37:17,263 --> 00:37:19,045
(Seolbong Building)

442
00:37:22,683 --> 00:37:23,827
Be careful.

443
00:37:30,102 --> 00:37:31,752
Oh, that.

444
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:33,626
What is it?

445
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:38,969
Isn't this the one, guys?

446
00:37:38,993 --> 00:37:41,600
Yes, I think it is.

447
00:37:41,953 --> 00:37:45,439
First off, we'll combine dynamite with depleted uranium...

448
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:47,037
to make depleted uranium explosives.

449
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:49,390
It was here.

450
00:37:51,252 --> 00:37:53,727
- Hey, be careful!
- Be careful.

451
00:37:55,502 --> 00:37:56,602
Careful.

452
00:37:57,633 --> 00:37:58,733
Be careful.

453
00:37:59,172 --> 00:38:00,328
This is not right.

454
00:38:00,473 --> 00:38:01,617
Gosh.

455
00:38:03,223 --> 00:38:04,323
There.

456
00:38:11,183 --> 00:38:12,381
Platoon Two, attention.

457
00:38:12,602 --> 00:38:13,579
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

458
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:15,708
Each team should figure out where to install the explosives...

459
00:38:15,732 --> 00:38:17,570
and install them while ensuring safety.

460
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:19,379
When you're all done,

461
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:22,131
move quickly to the rooftop of Seolbong Building and stand by.

462
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:24,139
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

463
00:38:24,163 --> 00:38:26,179
All teams, get to work.

464
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,391
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

465
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:44,109
Team One...

466
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:47,070
will restore power in the machine room.

467
00:38:51,812 --> 00:38:52,912
(Basement Floor)

468
00:39:11,953 --> 00:39:14,988
When the power is restored,

469
00:39:15,372 --> 00:39:17,627
the rest will place the explosives in the building.

470
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:26,109
Team Six will observe the spheres...

471
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,989
until the job is done...

472
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:31,038
and cover the other teams so that they can leave safely.

473
00:39:31,392 --> 00:39:35,208
If the spheres make an unusual move in the middle,

474
00:39:35,232 --> 00:39:36,420
report to me right away.

475
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:42,971
So what are we doing with the explosives, Soo Chul?

476
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:45,339
Didn't you hear Mr. Lee?

477
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:48,398
I got distracted because I chipped my nail.

478
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:53,598
We'll place the explosives, lure the spheres, and...

479
00:39:53,622 --> 00:39:54,767
And?

480
00:39:56,622 --> 00:39:57,777
Bam!

481
00:40:01,002 --> 00:40:03,346
It's simple.

482
00:40:03,593 --> 00:40:04,693
Simple, you say?

483
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:07,697
If we fail to place the explosives, we'll die.

484
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:10,446
If we fail to lure the spheres, we'll die.

485
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:13,001
If we fail to kill them all at once, we'll die.

486
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:18,587
We'll also die if we're distracted during this operation like you.

487
00:40:18,942 --> 00:40:20,955
What do you think? Is it simple?

488
00:40:23,613 --> 00:40:26,737
Where? Where do we look to keep watch?

489
00:40:26,823 --> 00:40:27,923
Gosh.

490
00:40:40,962 --> 00:40:42,106
- Duk Joong.
- Yes.

491
00:40:45,422 --> 00:40:47,949
- Duk Joong.
- Wait. I'm working on it.

492
00:40:47,973 --> 00:40:49,161
Take this.

493
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:50,739
- Jun Hee.
- Yes.

494
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:52,094
- So Yeon.
- Hold this.

495
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:54,409
Didn't you learn how to do this?

496
00:40:54,433 --> 00:40:57,328
Darn, I learned the easy way.

497
00:40:57,352 --> 00:40:59,668
When you're all done installing the explosives,

498
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:03,124
- Slowly.
- seal every door to the outside...

499
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,763
and move swiftly to the rooftop to stand by there.

500
00:41:09,283 --> 00:41:12,539
- Do we install the explosive here?
- Yes.

501
00:41:12,823 --> 00:41:14,208
Give it to me. I'll do it.

502
00:41:28,223 --> 00:41:29,873
What is this smell?

503
00:41:30,343 --> 00:41:33,236
- It keeps smelling like spheres.
- What?

504
00:41:34,852 --> 00:41:37,602
You know, there's this fishy smell peculiar to them.

505
00:41:54,372 --> 00:41:55,703
What's with this mood?

506
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:58,543
Hey, Young Soo. Do you have a crush on So Yeon?

507
00:41:59,962 --> 00:42:01,238
What are you saying? I don't.

508
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:04,342
I guess you do like her.

509
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:07,478
Hey, this is enough.

510
00:42:07,502 --> 00:42:11,683
Hey, you shouldn't say it stinks about a boy who likes you.

511
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,057
I mean, I really appreciate it. Right, Young Soo?

512
00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:17,371
Stop it.

513
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:21,958
What on earth? You don't stink at all.

514
00:42:21,982 --> 00:42:24,226
Hey, try smelling him again.

515
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:29,111
Darn, I told you to stop!

516
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:33,613
Are you out of your mind, you darn moron?

517
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:36,649
- Hey.
- Stop.

518
00:42:36,663 --> 00:42:39,280
This isn't the time to fight. Come back to your senses.

519
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:44,954
Wait until we talk later.

520
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:06,774
We'll lure the spheres,

521
00:43:07,613 --> 00:43:11,463
and when every entrance is sealed, we'll explode the bombs...

522
00:43:12,653 --> 00:43:14,303
and kill them all.

523
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:47,735
- They've started moving.
- What?

524
00:43:51,323 --> 00:43:52,511
Darn it.

525
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:57,633
Where?

526
00:44:01,703 --> 00:44:03,451
Hey, hold this.

527
00:44:04,962 --> 00:44:07,118
Mr. Lee, the spheres are moving unusually.

528
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:08,964
I think they're preparing to take off.

529
00:44:19,392 --> 00:44:22,142
- Already?
- Darn it.

530
00:44:22,642 --> 00:44:24,931
Guys, let's do it quickly.

531
00:44:26,522 --> 00:44:27,897
The kids.

532
00:44:28,812 --> 00:44:29,956
What about the kids?

533
00:44:30,272 --> 00:44:32,197
They aren't done with their job yet.

534
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:34,016
What do we do about them?

535
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:51,859
- Did you hear it?
- Yes.

536
00:44:51,883 --> 00:44:54,148
- Gosh.
- It's too soon. What do we do?

537
00:44:54,172 --> 00:44:55,648
Isn't it obvious? Let's install them quickly.

538
00:44:55,672 --> 00:44:57,739
- Let's move.
- Go.

539
00:44:57,763 --> 00:44:59,029
They're moving already?

540
00:44:59,053 --> 00:45:01,868
Gosh, this is strange.

541
00:45:01,892 --> 00:45:02,992
Darn it.

542
00:45:03,642 --> 00:45:05,868
What are you waiting for? Run!

543
00:45:05,892 --> 00:45:07,685
Goodness, gracious.

544
00:45:08,942 --> 00:45:12,561
We must change their direction before they arrive at the shelter.

545
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:21,328
Aren't you done yet?

546
00:45:24,832 --> 00:45:26,163
We have a few left.

547
00:45:28,502 --> 00:45:30,898
If we don't lure them now, the shelter will be attacked.

548
00:45:30,922 --> 00:45:32,308
But if this rings, they'll come in 10 minutes.

549
00:45:32,332 --> 00:45:33,531
What, 10 minutes?

550
00:45:34,843 --> 00:45:37,449
Let's wrap it up in 10 minutes and leave this place.

551
00:45:40,633 --> 00:45:43,339
Platoon Two, begin luring the spheres.

552
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:52,787
- Young Sin, can you do it?
- Yes, I think so.

553
00:45:53,403 --> 00:45:55,458
We'll begin the operation to lure the spheres now.

554
00:45:55,482 --> 00:45:58,168
Everyone, wrap it up in 10 minutes...

555
00:45:58,192 --> 00:45:59,842
and move to Seolbong Building.

556
00:46:00,283 --> 00:46:01,515
Are you kidding me?

557
00:46:18,093 --> 00:46:19,280
Gosh.

558
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:22,717
It's stuck!

559
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:23,993
Let me try.

560
00:46:25,303 --> 00:46:26,501
Push!

561
00:46:37,482 --> 00:46:38,682
Quickly!

562
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:46,941
All right, it's loud.

563
00:46:47,203 --> 00:46:50,228
One, two, three.

564
00:47:02,922 --> 00:47:05,728
Oh, come on!

565
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:09,578
My hands are so shaky that I can't do it properly.

566
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:12,441
- Let me do it.
- Help me.

567
00:47:14,482 --> 00:47:17,001
Aren't you done yet? We must get out now.

568
00:47:17,062 --> 00:47:18,580
I'm almost done.

569
00:47:18,613 --> 00:47:20,119
- Are you?
- Yes.

570
00:47:20,903 --> 00:47:22,102
Do we do it for real?

571
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:24,723
- Do it!
- Darn it.

572
00:47:33,752 --> 00:47:35,468
What are you waiting for? Smash it now!

573
00:47:37,672 --> 00:47:41,016
- They're almost here. Hurry up!
- Where are the others?

574
00:47:44,093 --> 00:47:45,659
We must go. Let's go!

575
00:47:45,683 --> 00:47:47,102
Let's go!

576
00:47:47,763 --> 00:47:49,511
- Run.
- Goodness.

577
00:47:49,973 --> 00:47:51,073
Gosh!

578
00:47:51,223 --> 00:47:53,015
(Seolbong Building)

579
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:03,394
Mr. Lee, we must get out now.

580
00:48:03,482 --> 00:48:05,782
I have to connect them all. I'm almost done.

581
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:07,671
We'll do the rest.

582
00:48:08,993 --> 00:48:10,643
Then finish it up in the hallway.

583
00:48:12,413 --> 00:48:13,513
Let's go.

584
00:48:29,392 --> 00:48:30,537
Let me help.

585
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:00,969
They're crowding in.

586
00:49:04,553 --> 00:49:05,972
Why aren't they coming?

587
00:49:08,553 --> 00:49:10,368
- Bo Ra.
- Guys. What about the others?

588
00:49:10,392 --> 00:49:11,625
- Gosh.
- Where?

589
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:17,206
There are too many!

590
00:49:18,312 --> 00:49:21,249
Darn, we're doomed.

591
00:49:22,772 --> 00:49:24,697
Mr. Lee, you must get out of there quickly!

592
00:49:24,823 --> 00:49:26,473
Run!

593
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:39,182
Go without me.

594
00:49:40,462 --> 00:49:41,562
Mr. Kim.

595
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:45,323
I'll follow you soon. Be careful.

596
00:49:51,513 --> 00:49:53,350
- Gosh.
- Darn it.

597
00:50:03,562 --> 00:50:06,962
- Come on. Do it faster.
- Darn it.

598
00:50:08,863 --> 00:50:10,227
How many more do you have left?

599
00:50:11,453 --> 00:50:12,916
A few more.

600
00:50:13,783 --> 00:50:14,883
Darn.

601
00:50:15,372 --> 00:50:16,517
Hurry.

602
00:50:20,082 --> 00:50:21,501
Darn it.

603
00:50:21,962 --> 00:50:23,502
We have no time. Finish it quickly!

604
00:50:31,013 --> 00:50:33,400
They went toward the main building, right?

605
00:50:34,642 --> 00:50:36,194
I can't see.

606
00:50:36,973 --> 00:50:39,129
Let's go downstairs.

607
00:50:40,522 --> 00:50:42,118
Goodness.

608
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:44,998
- What do we do?
- They shouldn't come this soon.

609
00:50:45,022 --> 00:50:47,129
- Guys!
- What?

610
00:50:47,153 --> 00:50:49,440
- What is it?
- Let's go first.

611
00:50:50,533 --> 00:50:53,589
- Gosh, where are you going?
- This way!

612
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:55,868
- What?
- Darn it.

613
00:50:56,033 --> 00:50:57,133
What do we do?

614
00:50:57,913 --> 00:51:00,768
- What is it?
- What? Why are they going there?

615
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:02,904
- Let's do this quickly.
- Darn.

616
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:08,742
Mr. Lee.

617
00:51:09,093 --> 00:51:11,568
The spheres have come very close.

618
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:17,653
Goodness.

619
00:51:20,013 --> 00:51:23,136
I'll wrap it up. Move to Seolbong Building.

620
00:51:23,142 --> 00:51:24,297
I'll do it.

621
00:51:26,192 --> 00:51:27,699
The kids' safety comes first.

622
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:30,384
Go with the kids.

623
00:51:31,192 --> 00:51:32,348
Now.

624
00:51:36,413 --> 00:51:37,920
Finish it and join us quickly.

625
00:51:40,082 --> 00:51:41,315
Kids, let's go downstairs.

626
00:51:42,453 --> 00:51:44,751
No, I'm not going.

627
00:51:48,332 --> 00:51:50,488
- Hurry and go.
- No.

628
00:51:53,303 --> 00:51:54,403
Now!

629
00:51:56,433 --> 00:51:57,577
No...

630
00:51:59,303 --> 00:52:01,538
I'm not going!

631
00:52:01,562 --> 00:52:02,662
Hurry up!

632
00:52:03,312 --> 00:52:05,288
I don't want to go.

633
00:52:05,312 --> 00:52:07,788
- Let's go.
- Hurry up!

634
00:52:07,812 --> 00:52:09,668
- I don't want to go.
- Come on!

635
00:52:09,692 --> 00:52:10,880
Go!

636
00:52:11,232 --> 00:52:13,895
- Go quickly.
- Move!

637
00:52:14,493 --> 00:52:15,637
Darn it.

638
00:52:33,962 --> 00:52:35,987
Darn, not again.

639
00:52:36,763 --> 00:52:38,457
There are too many.

640
00:52:39,142 --> 00:52:41,067
They're swarming in.

641
00:52:46,272 --> 00:52:47,372
What about the others?

642
00:52:52,022 --> 00:52:53,266
Soo Chul...

643
00:53:08,872 --> 00:53:10,027
Let's go.

644
00:53:20,803 --> 00:53:21,947
Let's go.

645
00:54:57,232 --> 00:54:58,432
Come quick.

646
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:17,143
Let's arrive safely first.

647
00:55:23,263 --> 00:55:24,407
Now.

648
00:55:27,723 --> 00:55:28,867
Darn it.

649
00:55:36,403 --> 00:55:37,590
Gosh.

650
00:55:43,743 --> 00:55:44,931
Gosh.

651
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:11,868
They should be here. Why aren't they coming yet?

652
00:56:11,892 --> 00:56:13,909
- Guys, they're coming.
- What?

653
00:56:13,933 --> 00:56:16,044
Young Sin, over here!

654
00:56:16,522 --> 00:56:19,458
- Gosh.
- Young Sin.

655
00:56:19,482 --> 00:56:20,770
Thank goodness.

656
00:56:23,073 --> 00:56:25,629
- Why is it just you two?
- Yeon Ju.

657
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:27,799
What about the rest?

658
00:56:27,823 --> 00:56:29,429
- Oh, no.
- Darn it.

659
00:56:29,453 --> 00:56:30,993
- Why aren't they coming?
- What...

660
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:38,230
Gosh.

661
00:56:47,593 --> 00:56:48,693
Goodness.

662
00:58:23,153 --> 00:58:25,748
- They're here.
- Oh, it's them.

663
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:27,753
- Eun Young.
- Thank goodness.

664
00:58:28,232 --> 00:58:31,126
- Are you okay?
- Yes, what about you?

665
00:58:36,122 --> 00:58:37,630
Jang Soo, connect the line.

666
00:58:38,953 --> 00:58:42,188
What about Mr. Lee?

667
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:43,400
What happened?

668
00:58:46,712 --> 00:58:47,812
Everyone,

669
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:51,426
stand by here...

670
00:58:53,803 --> 00:58:55,387
until there's an order from Mr. Lee.

671
00:58:56,053 --> 00:58:58,538
- What?
- Why?

672
00:58:58,852 --> 00:58:59,996
- What?

So Yeon, what happened?

674
00:59:01,812 --> 00:59:04,980
- So Yeon, where's Mr. Lee?
- Why isn't he here?

675
00:59:05,403 --> 00:59:06,778
- So Yeon.
- What is it?

676
00:59:07,522 --> 00:59:09,106
- What happened?
- What is going on?

- Mr. Lee.

Initiate...

683
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:19,916
the explosion now.

684
01:01:20,073 --> 01:01:22,779
But you are still in the building.

685
01:01:25,622 --> 01:01:27,228
I'm not, so explode the building.

688
01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:43,871
No, Mr. Lee. Get out of there now. Quickly!

689
01:01:44,183 --> 01:01:45,283
Mr. Lee.

690
01:01:46,142 --> 01:01:47,429
I'll go now.

- What?
- I'll go too.

Kim Won Bin, pull yourself together.

If you don't explode the building now,

695
01:01:59,783 --> 01:02:00,883
all of us will die.

696

Blow it, Won Bin.

01:02:18,922 --> 01:02:20,672
I can't escape anyway.

701
01:02:21,263 --> 01:02:22,825
Don't let me die in vain.

No...

- No.
- There is no other way.

710
01:03:17,192 --> 01:03:19,074
You promised...

711
01:03:21,073 --> 01:03:24,010
that you'd protect us until the end.

712
01:03:26,453 --> 01:03:29,566
So please get out of there.

713
01:03:29,663 --> 01:03:32,138
Please!

714
01:03:45,433 --> 01:03:46,621
I'm sorry...

715

I can't protect you until the end...

716
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:54,219
as I promised.

717
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:57,586
And...

718
01:03:59,272 --> 01:04:01,978
for dragging you into this war as an adult.

719
01:04:11,493 --> 01:04:15,397
At first, I thought you were just disobedient kids.

720
01:04:18,672 --> 01:04:20,510
But now that I think about it,

721

I'm so grateful...

722
01:04:27,383 --> 01:04:28,538
and proud of you.

723
01:04:31,053 --> 01:04:32,571
Thanks to you,

724

this endless war...

725
01:04:38,153 --> 01:04:40,209
didn't feel so frightening.

726
01:04:42,482 --> 01:04:43,726
So,

727
01:04:44,283 --> 01:04:46,252
trust and rely...

728
01:04:47,743 --> 01:04:50,262
on the friends next to you.

729
01:04:53,042 --> 01:04:54,825
Protect each other.

731
01:05:03,922 --> 01:05:05,122
do not get killed.

This is my last order.

733
01:05:28,113 --> 01:05:31,468
Initiate the explosion.

- Don't do it.
- No...
