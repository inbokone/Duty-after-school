1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,385
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:11,885
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,520
- What?
- What was that?

4
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:23,762
That almost made me jump.

5
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,347
- What was that?
- What's that sound?

6
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:28,490
- It hurts!
- Sorry, Yeon Ju.

7
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,130
Young Hoon.

8
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,890
Young Hoon.

9
00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:36,395
Watch out!

10
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:54,736
Private Chi Yeol. Are you all right?

11
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,847
Private Chi Yeol.

12
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,745
(Original Work: "Duty After School" from Naver Webtoon)

13
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,326
(Duty After School)

14
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,073
Yes, sir.

15
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,133
Those spheres.

16
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:23,183
You said that they weren't dangerous.

17
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,963
You clearly said...

18
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,103
that the school was safe and nothing would happen.

19
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,652
But...

20
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,385
how did Young Hoon...

21
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:36,006
We were not able to predict Private Young Hoon's death.

22
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,229
Young Hoon...

23
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,944
was not a soldier.

24
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:41,858
He was a student.

25
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:48,288
What do I do with my students now?

26
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,485
Shouldn't I send them home?

27
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:53,940
Please keep it a secret for now.

28
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,616
- Excuse me?
- To prevent nationwide confusion,

29
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,406
we have orders to keep our mouths shut...

30
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,716
about the spheres.

31
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,325
To minimize the confusion when this becomes known,

32
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:06,057
- the countermeasures are...
- A student has died!

33
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,086
Such a dangerous thing is at school, and the kids...

34
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,310
The kids are already under military supervision.

35
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,961
Everything will be handled...

36
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,047
according to military laws.

37
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:03,447
I'll tell the kids.

38
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,465
Are you all right? Any injuries?

39
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:42,327
It's all good. I'm here for you.

40
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,178
It's not your fault, guys.

41
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:04,901
It was an accident.

42
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:09,630
So, don't beat yourself up about it.

43
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,619
Come and talk to me when you're distressed,

44
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:14,280
and during class...

45
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,166
You know what? You should take a few weeks off.

46
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,389
What do you say?

47
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:26,864
Sorry.

48
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:28,727
I'm also...

49
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,683
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

50
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,772
Let's tell them...

51
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:06,609
that Young Hoon got hurt and went home.

52
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,268
Otherwise, it'll stir them up.

53
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:12,295
I'll...

54
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:15,046
talk to them about it later.

55
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,894
I hope you'll keep it from the other kids.

56
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,135
Can you do that?

57
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,740
Yes.

58
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,502
And Chi Yeol?

59
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,800
Hey, Kimchi.

60
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,974
Kimchi!

61
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:54,315
Hey.

62
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,637
You heard Ms. Park, right?

63
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:59,552
Don't run your mouth in front of them.

64
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,420
You saw it too.

65
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,152
He started the fight with me.

66
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,114
To be fair, it wasn't even my fault.

67
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:13,595
Young Hoon just got unlucky.

68
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,862
So, lie low...

69
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,555
unless you want to be an outcast like he was.

70
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,533
(Lee Chun Ho)

71
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:46,065
Lieutenant Lee.

72
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:47,736
How did the sphere attack?

73
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,236
Division? You mean that it split into pieces?

74
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,053
Can't you hear me? Lieutenant Lee!

75
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,392
Help!

76
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,336
Help!

77
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,647
Watch out!

78
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,318
Please!

79
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,797
Help!

80
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,326
Come on.

81
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,596
Okay.

82
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,855
- Go!
- Seriously.

83
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,655
I heard a thud earlier.

84
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,076
Was there a car accident?

85
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,575
- Crap.
- All right.

86
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,793
Hey.

87
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,866
How are you studying in this situation?

88
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,885
You...

89
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,624
Ignore him.

90
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,259
Let's play.

91
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:51,849
Here I go.

92
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:54,092
- It's my turn.
- Fine.

93
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:00,168
- Here we go.
- Chi Yeol.

94
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,876
Didn't you hear anything outside?

95
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,459
Why are only the two of you back? Where's Young Hoon?

96
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:08,326
Well...

97
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,494
He...

98
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,143
hurt himself and went home.

99
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,360
He hurt himself? Where?

100
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,968
Just his body.

101
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:28,312
How did he hurt himself?

102
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,735
He just hurt himself.

103
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,493
It must have been pretty bad if he had to go home.

104
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,165
Is he coming back?

105
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,495
I guess not.

106
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,430
He likes to play solo.

107
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:45,851
No way.

108
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:48,848
Young Hoon said no to extra points on the CSAT?

109
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,315
- Are you smiling?
- No.

110
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,963
Well, I'm glad it's him.

111
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:01,076
If it was a close friend of mine,

112
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,805
I would have pitied him.

113
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:05,626
- Am I right?
- Right.

114
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,086
Good for you, Young Soo.

115
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,222
You're the top student if Young Hoon isn't here.

116
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:11,256
Are you finally living up to your name?

117
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,436
Studied Korean, Math, and English his whole life,

118
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:15,420
- Kook Young Soo.
- Kook Young Soo.

119
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,183
I'm not happy.

120
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:20,726
You're holding your laughter.

121
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,982
No, I'm not.

122
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,226
- Yes, you are!
- Hey!

123
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,185
- You can't hide your smile.
- You're so happy.

124
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:27,683
I'm really not.

125
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:28,856
Young Soo.

126
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,655
- Why do you study so hard?
- What's wrong?

127
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,375
You look seriously anxious.

128
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,915
- A doctor?
- A doctor?

129
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,414
Did something happen?

130
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:53,799
No.

131
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,346
Starting yesterday, all high school students...

132
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,435
have started studying and getting military training.

133
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:06,895
- ID, please.
- The authorities are putting...

134
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,394
priority on safety to prevent accidents.

135
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:11,185
Next up in the news. Last night,

136
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:14,065
spheres have dropped all over the country, including Seoul.

137
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:17,655
About 30 spheres seems to have fallen,

138
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,236
- and the damage...
- Ms. Park.

139
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,905
Has not been announced yet.

140
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:22,706
- When you come across a sphere, - Ms. Park!

141
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,785
- Yes?
- Do not approach it or touch it...

142
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:26,376
- Thank you.
- And make sure to alert...

143
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,557
the nearby troops or police force.

144
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:30,801
Thank you.

145
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,335
(Jang Young Hoon)

146
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,571
So, those loud thuds were the spheres dropping?

147
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,155
The guys in Class Three told me...

148
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,104
that the gym was demolished.

149
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:05,956
That must have been it.

150
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,376
If it destroyed a building,

151
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,093
I bet the impact was huge.

152
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,126
- You scared me!
- Come on!

153
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,668
- Sorry.
- Shoot.

154
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,347
- That was not funny!
- Awesome.

155
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:22,305
Move! I need to write this.

156
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:23,750
Idiot.

157
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:26,795
That was uncool.

158
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,395
Maybe Young Hoon got hurt by one of the spheres.

159
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:31,609
What?

160
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,136
Well, the timing's right.

161
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,305
Right. It is.

162
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,655
- This is so stupid!
- Come on!

163
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,986
Get away from me.

164
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,496
- Is it reddening?
- It is.

165
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,345
- Absolutely.
- It's swelling.

166
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,076
Hey!

167
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,762
- Attention.
- At ease.

168
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,246
- Did you send the report?
- Yes, sir.

169
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,295
You got the reply, right?

170
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:55,216
- We're working on it.
- Gosh.

171
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,425
They never told us that those things were...

172
00:13:57,449 --> 00:13:58,945
capable of attacking us, did they?

173
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,846
Gosh.

174
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,596
So, what do we do now?

175
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,600
The accident last night occurred out of the blue.

176
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:07,135
The students aren't prepared to...

177
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:09,095
So, we should train them, shouldn't we?

178
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,765
Get them ready for rifle drills. Okay?

179
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:13,901
- Yes, sir.
- Don't you think it's too soon?

180
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,435
Hey!

181
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:17,986
They could be on the battlefield in no time.

182
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,025
We should at least teach them how to shoot before that.

183
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:22,424
Get to work now!

184
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,876
You fire a gun at a monkey hanging on a tree.

185
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:36,356
The scared monkey lets go of the tree and free falls.

186
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,836
Then,

187
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,083
can the bullet hit the monkey?

188
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:44,607
Anyone?

189
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:46,425
At least, try and make a guess.

190
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:48,096
Gosh.

191
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,726
Come on. How many ambulances are there today?

192
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,856
It's so loud.

193
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,155
You're loudest.

194
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,435
Close the windows.

195
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,775
- Come on! It's hot.
- It's hot.

196
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,986
But it's hot.

197
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,716
Turn on the air-conditioner.

198
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,405
There's another ambulance.

199
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:05,125
Oh, gosh.

200
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,541
Hey.

201
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,576
- Doesn't it sound like that?
- Like what?

202
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,576
"Death or life."

203
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,898
"Death or life..."

204
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,126
The ones by the windows, close them.

205
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,624
- Okay.
- Okay.

206
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,034
Vy is...

207
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,109
Kids.

208
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,475
Listen carefully.

209
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,591
I said earlier...

210
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,328
that no one could help you with your life.

211
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,091
So,

212
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,326
study hard...

213
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,836
and train hard.

214
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,510
Understood? Do everything hard!

215
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:00,584
- Okay?
- Okay.

216
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,936
Go!

217
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,971
- It hurts.
- Keep moving!

218
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,656
Focus.

219
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:11,515
Move quickly.

220
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:14,432
Hold on to your rifle and headgear.

221
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,226
- It hurts!
- Don't stop!

222
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,435
Move faster!

223
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:19,476
Get out of there!

224
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,315
- Keep your rifle in your left hand.
- What do you think you're doing?

225
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:24,356
- Move swiftly!
- Hey!

226
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,196
- Get out of there!
- Come on, move!

227
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,736
To the next one.

228
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,576
- Come on.
- Keep moving.

229
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,946
- Faster.
- Go.

230
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,956
To the left.

231
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,630
Keep your rifles up!

232
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,963
Hurry it up!

233
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,006
Who's standing still?

234
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,843
- Run!
- Let's do this!

235
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,216
All trainees, into your assault fire positions.

236
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,570
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

237
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:51,515
Prone position in parts. One!

238
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:52,815
- One.
- One.

239
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:54,746
- Two.
- Two.

240
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:56,555
- Three.
- Three.

241
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,395
Stand up. Prone position in parts.

242
00:16:58,419 --> 00:16:59,565
- One!
- One!

243
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:01,025
- Two.
- Louder!

244
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:04,065
- Quickly.
- Do not meet eyes with me.

245
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,405
- Why are you looking at me?
- Put your head up.

246
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:07,616
Aim forward!

247
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,826
Pick up your rifles!

248
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,785
Who has the rifle facing the ground?

249
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:12,035
- Aim forward.
- Look up.

250
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,568
Look up!

251
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:18,395
This is too hard.

252
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,496
Mom...

253
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,774
I just want to give up and go home.

254
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,663
But if I do,

255
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,446
I can't get the extra points that everyone else gets.

256
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,829
That's what I'm worried about.

257
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,515
All trainees,

258
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:36,555
focus and keep the stone on the barrel...

259
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:37,679
as you pull the trigger.

260
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:39,355
Relax your body.

261
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:40,710
Hold your breath.

262
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,896
Focus.

263
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,064
Fire.

264
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,021
You can do it. Why do you...

265
00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:47,906
Do you have hand tremors?

266
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:48,906
Young Soo.

267
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,218
Study the rifle as you study books.

268
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:54,183
Come on! Darn it.

269
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,956
The platoon commander is watching Hurry.

270
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,311
Fine.

271
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:11,994
Move it.

272
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,095
Stand up.

273
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,659
- Next, keep moving.
- Get in line.

274
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:20,405
- Hold your rifles properly.
- Get moving.

275
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:22,353
Left flank, march!

276
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,206
You have to be stupid to take this training seriously.

277
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,618
Studying in my spare time is the best for me.

278
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,115
I just hope none of my classmates get hurt.

279
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:33,604
I don't want this crap!

280
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:35,285
What is this?

281
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:36,917
This looks like rice cake.

282
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,365
- This is gross!
- I think it's gone bad.

283
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:41,456
I'm serious. Try it.

284
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,085
Start disassembling your rifles from Group One.

285
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:45,666
Group One, begin disassembling.

286
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,006
- Begin!
- Begin!

287
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,716
When you've finished disassembling your rifle,

288
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,852
raise your hand and make sure to show me.

289
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,315
Hey, you have to put one on it so that I can start!

290
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:04,617
Sorry.

291
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,606
This is insane.

292
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:14,865
- Pull the trigger.
- What?

293
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:16,123
Pull it.

294
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,569
You can't do it even if I put one on it.

295
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,756
I am doing my best, but...

296
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,756
(Class 3-2, No Ae Seol)

297
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,517
But this keeps coming loose.

298
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,256
Is yours okay?

299
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,426
- Are you okay?
- Wake up!

300
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,595
- Check the patient's breath.
- Check the breath!

301
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:39,676
- Checking.
- If the patient is not breathing,

302
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,886
apply pressure to the chest.

303
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,896
- Begin!
- Begin!

304
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,936
Wake up!

305
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,355
- Keep going.
- Come on!

306
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:47,029
Oh, my legs.

307
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,646
Hey, Kimchi. Drink water.

308
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,825
Okay.

309
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,491
Drink up.

310
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,851
What's the matter?

311
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:06,343
Hey.

312
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:09,648
Chi Yeol.

313
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:13,469
What do you mean, "How is it?"

314
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,721
It feels like crap.

315
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:16,689
Hey.

316
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,555
Find somebody else to interview.

317
00:20:18,579 --> 00:20:20,594
(Class 3-2, Kwon Il Ha)

318
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,664
- Guys.
- What?

319
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:28,686
Yu Jung.

320
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,686
Leave them be. I'll let you study by yourself today.

321
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,865
Okay.

322
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,085
There are more students remaining than the ones who left.

323
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:55,216
(Class 3-2, Cho Young Sin)

324
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,132
It's better to go with the majority in such cases.

325
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,071
This is nice.

326
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:04,805
But I only wore it for five days. Maybe I shouldn't wash it.

327
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:06,393
Five days? Give me that.

328
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:11,079
Why would you smell that?

329
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:12,315
But...

330
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,736
he said it's only been five days.

331
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,196
- Come on!
- Stop!

332
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,736
You're nasty!

333
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,815
Come on!

334
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,315
During night watch?

335
00:21:19,849 --> 00:21:22,035
Chatting with the girls is...

336
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:23,325
pretty nice.

337
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,246
(Class 3-2, Kim Duk Joong)

338
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,238
It'd be so cool to be on watch with Ha Na.

339
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,875
Make me look especially prettier.

340
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:33,256
I want to date a British guy too.

341
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,335
- A British guy?
- But you don't even speak English.

342
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,386
Those animals are right outside.

343
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,595
We have to dry our underwear here?

344
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:39,886
Exactly!

345
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,386
- What if they steal it?
- That's what I'm saying.

346
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,845
You two are so grouchy.

347
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,305
How are you two so alike?

348
00:21:45,329 --> 00:21:46,595
She and I?

349
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:48,186
- That's offensive to me.
- No, it's offensive to me.

350
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,686
Keep hanging the laundry.

351
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,777
Why are you throwing things?

352
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,589
Is he staring at me?

353
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,565
Pervert!

354
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:56,696
Those guys are...

355
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,565
- You guys are crazy!
- Perverts.

356
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:00,615
- What a pervert.
- I got goosebumps.

357
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,236
How long have they been standing there?

358
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,591
- Look at them.
- Creeps.

359
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:12,666
- Tae Man, get changed!
- You smell awful.

360
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,795
You stink.

361
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:15,007
What?

362
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,461
- Wash your clothes, man.
- Get away from me!

363
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,642
- You're crazy.
- Do you want one?

364
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,015
Thanks.

365
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,386
(Class 3-2, Cha So Yeon)

366
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,896
I just washed, and I still stink.

367
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,183
Ha Na, smell me.

368
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,423
- I don't smell anything.
- I don't?

369
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,391
What about me? Smell me.

370
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:45,535
What? Smell me again. That can't be true.

371
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,115
No, I'm starting to hate you.

372
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:48,996
- Please smell me.
- Not again.

373
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,575
There's no way.

374
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:53,494
We will keep trying until you don't drop the stone.

375
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,093
- It's shaking. Hold your breath.
- One second.

376
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,467
Private So Yeon.

377
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:05,142
Pull in your elbows.

378
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,273
Relax your left hand.

379
00:23:12,879 --> 00:23:14,155
Hold your breath.

380
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,198
Focus.

381
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,407
Fire.

382
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:36,916
The hardest part?

383
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,875
(Class 3-2, Lee Na Ra)

384
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,230
So far, none.

385
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,256
It's amazing!

386
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,392
Na Ra succeeded!

387
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:53,273
Yu Jung succeeded too.

388
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,029
- I did it!
- Yes.

389
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:58,736
- You did well.
- Did you see that?

390
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,036
Get into your positions!

391
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,539
- Move forward!
- Hurry and get out.

392
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,903
You jerks!

393
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:10,594
I feel alive.

394
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,535
- Move faster to the next.
- Run!

395
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,673
Move quickly!

396
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,330
Eat more.

397
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:19,282
Hey, stop.

398
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,943
Quickly be back into your positions.

399
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,835
- Get into your positions.
- Run!

400
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:25,926
- Run quickly!
- Go ahead!

401
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,095
- Ready.
- Run!

402
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:28,216
- Run!
- Pull yourself together!

403
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,765
- Let's do this!
- Assume the prone position!

404
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:31,976
- Basic movement, one!
- One!

405
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,845
- Two!
- Two!

406
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:35,706
- Three!
- Three!

407
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:58,253
Anyhow,

408
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,625
I don't feel safe.

409
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:02,675
I really didn't tell anyone!

410
00:25:08,369 --> 00:25:09,515
Look.

411
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:11,765
I said you're dangerous.

412
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:14,936
I seriously won't tell anyone. Okay?

413
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,929
- I won't tell even if I die.
- Is that so?

414
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,291
I'll see.

415
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,483
If you won't tell after you die.

416
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:23,693
What?

417
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:43,394
Don't do this!

418
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,216
- You punk!
- Oh, gosh!

419
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,471
Come here.

420
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,846
Darn it. Where did he go?

421
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,364
Darn it.

422
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,423
For goodness' sake.

423
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,894
Please.

424
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,227
(Jang Young Hoon)

425
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,780
Kim Chi Yeol.

426
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:22,546
Where are you going?

427
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,770
I'm going to the bathroom.

428
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,722
Make it fast.

429
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,378
Na Ra.

430
00:29:13,609 --> 00:29:14,940
What are you doing here?

431
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:19,483
I can't sleep after being on a night watch.

432
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,179
How about you?

433
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,054
Well, I...

434
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,081
just woke up for no reason.

435
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,396
(Goodbye, friends.)

436
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,752
I think they're the names of the people who went out.

437
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:40,236
(3-2: Baek Su Young, Cha Seung Ho, Jang Young Hoon)

438
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,712
If I had known this would happen,

439
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:43,862
I would have gotten closer to them.

440
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,785
Is Young Hoon hurt a lot?

441
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:48,008
What?

442
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,580
No.

443
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,424
Just...

444
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,290
a little bit.

445
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:06,403
(Jang Young Hoon, give "birth" soon.)

446
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,476
That letter means to give birth.

447
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,700
Yes? What did you say?

448
00:30:11,589 --> 00:30:12,733
Never mind.

449
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,315
You lived in England, right?

450
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:19,365
Yes, why?

451
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:22,333
Just asking.

452
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,360
Chi Yeol,

453
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,503
were you close with Young Hoon?

454
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,136
We were born and raised in the same village.

455
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:39,487
Then you must've been close with him.

456
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:45,469
Yes.

457
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:51,309
I'll go first.

458
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:17,125
(Jang Young Hoon, get well soon.)

459
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:23,386
(Jang Young Hoon, get well soon.)

460
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,506
I'll give you a minute to disassemble and assemble the gun.

461
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,875
- What?
- Sorry?

462
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:00,595
If you can't get it done in a minute,

463
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:02,795
you'll get a penalty.

464
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:04,108
- What?
- A penalty?

465
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,227
Who whined?

466
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:11,929
Come out.

467
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,325
Group One, disassemble and assemble the gun.

468
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,775
Start.

469
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,987
- Start!
- Start!

470
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:25,411
So Yeon, does he still look cool to you?

471
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:28,785
So Yeon?

472
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:31,825
Yes, whatever he does is so cool.

473
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,996
- Disassemble complete.
- Disassemble complete.

474

00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:35,383
- Who?
- What's next?

476
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,835
- Is it me?
- Disassemble complete.

477
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:38,412
Shut it, squid.

478
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:39,875
"Squid?"

- Nice work.
- Yes.

501
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:52,453
Stop.

502
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,305
One minute passed.

503
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:57,598
Assemble the rifle again.

504
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,637
Private Ae Seol.

505
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,316
Assemble the rifle again.

506
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,423
- Yes.
- Hey.

507
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:13,660
She's lost.

508
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:21,099
Again.

509
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:23,596
Why can't she do this?

510
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:25,370
- Again.
- Gosh.

511
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:27,519
Again.

512
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,445
- She just took it off now?
- Again.

513
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,775
- How long do we need to wait?
- She's doing her best.

514
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:33,326
My butt hurts.

515
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,110
- How many times is she trying?
- Again.

516
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,366
- Oh, gosh.
- I'm hungry.

517
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,546
- Gosh.
- She's taking it off.

518
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,392
- Again.
- What? Come on.

519
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:45,165
- For goodness' sake!
- Again?

520
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:50,716
(Sungjin High School)

521
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,216
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ae Seol, make it quick.

522
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,756
- I'm so tired.
- Do it well!

523
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,636
- Please.
- When is this ending?

524
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,541
- I'm starving.
- Oh, gosh.

525
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,541
I'm so tired.

526
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,686
Seriously.

527
00:35:04,129 --> 00:35:05,935
I'm about to die of hunger.

528
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,433
Same here.

529
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:11,357
Hey, can you hear me?

530
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,177
Group Two, attention.

531
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,665
Attention!

532
00:35:26,939 --> 00:35:29,702
There are no individuals or me on the training ground.

533
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,321
There's only us.

534
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,733
But...

535
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,345
you criticize your friends' mistakes...

536
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,415
and jeer at them.

537
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,082
If this was a real situation,

538
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:47,573
you guys would all be dead already.

539
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,128
Therefore,

540
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,107
until the last person succeeds,

541
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,862
you will not be getting any dinner tonight.

542
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,286
- Gosh.
- What?

543
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,036
- That's not fair.
- We're starving.

544
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,366
- Seriously.
- I'm starving too.

545
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,036
Come on, that's not fair.

546
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,127
- What is this?
- This is so annoying.

547
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:07,639
Private No Ae Seol.

548
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,104
Begin.

549
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:34,275
We're eating such great food thanks to somebody.

550
00:36:34,299 --> 00:36:37,282
I know. This food is totally awesome.

551
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,709
Hey.

552
00:36:43,729 --> 00:36:44,963
Hey.

553
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:48,695
You know we're eating this garbage because of you, right?

554
00:36:50,189 --> 00:36:51,432
Sorry.

555
00:36:51,569 --> 00:36:53,153
Do you think saying sorry is enough?

556
00:36:54,819 --> 00:36:56,020
Sorry.

557
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,361
Hey!

558
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,809
Stop it. Ae Seol is eating.

559
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,816
Hey. This isn't the first time, you know.

560
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:07,855
If it was, I wouldn't even be complaining.

561
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:10,563
If you have something to say, say it after we're done eating.

562
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:15,932
Who are you? Her boyfriend or something?

563
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,754
If I'm her boyfriend, can I say that kind of stuff?

564
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,975
Then I'll be her boyfriend.

565
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,382
- Is that punk crazy?
- What?

566
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:26,536
He must be crazy.

567
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,077
Are they going out?

568
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:30,585
Are they actually dating?

569
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:32,173
You're making me lose my appetite.

570
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,765
Eat up.

571
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,298
Hey. Big news.

572
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,027
What's this?

573
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,926
I'm upset by this reaction.

574
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,193
Just eat.

575
00:37:46,959 --> 00:37:48,796
Okay. I won't tell you.

576
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,895
Big news.

577
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,605
What is it?

578
00:37:54,629 --> 00:37:56,829
Now that's the kind of reaction I was looking for.

579
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,261
Tomorrow,

580
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:00,174
we're shooting real bullets.

581
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,952
I know that too.

582
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,498
What?

583
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,165
- We all know, man.
- How?

584
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:11,886
It says so on the training schedule in the front of the classroom.

585
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:18,658
How smart you are.

586
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,317
You're awesome!

587
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,936
I've checked the route to the shooting range.

588
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,334
- Good work, Won Bin.
- Thank you, sir.

589
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,536
Bring the weapons too.

590
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,846
Those too?

591
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,665
I heard they were still being tested.

592
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:56,526
We never know what might happen.

593
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:58,966
Watch over them carefully so there aren't any accidents.

594
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,321
Yes, sir.

595
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,018
But...

596
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,742
they're quite pretty when you look at them like this.

597
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,705
The spheres, I mean.

598
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:18,315
- You're not getting it right.
- One...

599
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:19,525
Hey, stop playing around.

600
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:20,946
- Gosh, seriously?
- Gosh.

601
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,525
- My gosh.
- This is annoying.

602
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:24,707
- There you go.
- Are you doing my whole face?

603
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,696
I'm here.

604
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,656
You're late. Hurry up.

605
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,415
- Ms. Park.
- Hey. Yes?

606
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,875
Ms. Park, are you coming...

607
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:33,415
- to the shooting range with us?
- Class 2, total 22, no absentees.

608
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,745
- Of course, I'm coming with you.
- All clear.

609
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:36,287
- Don't worry.
- Yes!

610
00:39:36,569 --> 00:39:39,466
Just focus on your training. Let me see. Do you have everything?

611
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,227
Platoon Two, status check is complete.

612
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:43,426
- I know, right?
- We're shooting real bullets today.

613
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,968
Oh, gosh.

614
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,749
Hey, just stay still.

615
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,543
- That's not it.
- Stop playing around.

616
00:39:53,209 --> 00:39:54,628
We're all set.

617
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:57,775
- Oh, come on.
- Be quiet, guys.

618
00:39:57,799 --> 00:39:59,174
Platoon Two, attention.

619
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:00,632
- Attention!
- Attention!

620
00:40:01,129 --> 00:40:04,025
Follow along so we don't lose anyone on our way to the shooting range.

621
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:05,250
Got it?

622
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:06,907
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

623
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,529
Platoon Two. March.

624
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,221
- March!
- March!

625
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,377
- Stop that.
- What are you doing?

626
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,766
Hey, look.

627
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,435
Hey, you scared me.

628
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:32,636
You get scared too easily.

629
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,814
Oh, darn it!

630
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,032
What's this? Why are the streets empty?

631
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:40,516
I know, right? All the shops are closed too.

632
00:40:41,209 --> 00:40:43,466
People might think the world has come to an end.

633
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,951
Oh, gosh.

634
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,309
Where is everyone?

635
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,938
- It feels eerie.
- Everyone is gone.

636
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,915
There were fire trucks yesterday, but I can't even hear those today.

637
00:40:57,939 --> 00:40:59,314
Isn't that right?

638
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,240
- Do you need to go poop?
- Darn it.

639
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,676
Why are you asking him when you're the one who wants to poop?

640
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,795
Hey, Kim Duk Joong.

641
00:41:07,819 --> 00:41:08,846
- Darn it.
- Platoon Two.

642
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,389
Remain silent as we move to the shooting range.

643
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,509
Silent! No talking!

644
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:24,588
This is no fun.

645
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,511
- Hey, get a move on.
- Okay.

646
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,527
- One.
- One!

647
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,312
Two.

648
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,016
- One.
- Down! Shoot!

649
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,056
- Two.
- Down. Shoot.

650
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,509
- One.
- Look straight ahead.

651
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:02,525
- Stand up. Shoot!
- Salute.

652
00:42:02,549 --> 00:42:04,355
- Were things okay on your way here?
- Stand up. Shoot.

653
00:42:04,379 --> 00:42:07,065
Class 3-2. Line up in front of your platoon sergeant!

654
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:08,521
- Line up.
- Line up.

655
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,406
- No.
- We're here!

656
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,786
Who are those guys?

657
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,086
I don't know.

658
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,004
No talking!

659
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,085
Line up!

660
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:27,673
- Get up.
- Get up.

661
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:29,295
Oh, my gosh!

662
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:30,545
(Class 3-2, Im Woo Taek)

663
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:32,056
The sound of gunshots is...

664
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,005
so freaking loud.

665
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,516
I nearly pooped my pants, let alone wet myself.

666
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,185
Earlier, Duk Joong seriously pooped his pants.

667
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:42,855
(Class 3-2, Kim Duk Joong)

668
00:42:42,879 --> 00:42:44,661
The poop won't stop coming out.

669
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,826
Starting with those who are ready,

670
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:55,075
commence zeroing fire.

671
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,142
- Commence fire.
- Commence fire.

672
00:43:04,269 --> 00:43:05,382
One.

673
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:07,318
- One.
- One.

674
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,761
One!

675
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,173
One!

676
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,600
- One!
- One.

677
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,325
- One.
- One.

678
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:18,596
- One.
- One.

679
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,766
I just thought...

680
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,605
that it would be scary if a war broke out.

681
00:43:21,629 --> 00:43:22,766
I just thought...

682
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,775
that I wanted to go home.

683
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,119
But...

684
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:28,317
isn't Kwon Il Ha acting a bit weird these days?

685
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,156
Even when we're smoking, he keeps spacing out on his own.

686
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,065
(Class 3-2, Yeon Bo Ra)

687
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:34,796
I mean, he has always been a weirdo.

688
00:43:38,729 --> 00:43:40,335
Don't tell Il Ha.

689
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:44,064
Clear on the left.

690
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:45,495
Clear on the right.

691
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:46,705
All clear.

692
00:43:46,729 --> 00:43:48,915
Shooters, check your target.

693
00:43:48,939 --> 00:43:50,921
- Check targets.
- Check targets.

694
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,076
Kim Chi Yeol.

695
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,572
- Kim Chi Yeol.
- What?

696
00:44:07,169 --> 00:44:08,412
Are you okay?

697
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,664
Why is your face so red?

698
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,297
My face?

699
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,927
Where?

700
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:27,131
Right here.

701
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:31,190
Are you okay? It looks like a bruise.

702
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,019
Oh, this? It must be that.

703
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,425
When I was getting ready to shoot,

704
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,766
I was trying to set my sight,

705
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,528
so I put it right up against my nose.

706
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,811
But then, because of the recoil...

707
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:51,368
You should be careful too. The recoil is no joke.

708
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,559
Okay. Got it. Thanks.

709
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,366
- Kim Chi Yeol.
- What... Yes?

710
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:01,052
Aren't you going to check your target? Run!

711
00:45:06,149 --> 00:45:09,125
- What were you doing? Dating?
- Sorry, sir!

712
00:45:09,149 --> 00:45:11,074
- Hey, you did well.
- Gosh.

713
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,625
Hey, you...

714
00:45:12,649 --> 00:45:14,125
- You just kept shooting.
- When did I do that?

715
00:45:14,149 --> 00:45:16,506
- Hey, I saw everything.
- Your face was hilarious.

716
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:17,506
When did I do that?

717
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:18,636
Platoon Two, attention.

718
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,354
- Attention.
- Attention.

719
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,487
Private number three.

720
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,306
Private number three, Kim Duk Joong.

721
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,705
I gave you three shots.

722
00:45:29,169 --> 00:45:30,588
Why is there only one hole?

723
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:36,260
With my amazing shooting skills, all three rounds hit the bulls-eye.

724
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,196
- No way, really?
- Come on.

725
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,463
- Awesome.
- Unbelievable.

726
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,326
That's amazing.

727
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,769
- Get down.
- Get down?

728
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:46,856
Who's poking holes right now?

729
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:51,205
Private number 12, Wang Tae Man.

730
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:53,992
Wang Tae Man. Get down.

731
00:45:54,399 --> 00:45:55,730
Get down.

732
00:45:56,399 --> 00:45:57,506
That little punk.

733
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,466
- Are you joking?
- How badly did he do?

734
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,371
- Private number eight.
- Yes, sir.

735
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,549
Private number eight, Do Soo Chul.

736
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:07,508
Why do you have eight holes?

737
00:46:07,709 --> 00:46:08,996
Is this the solar system?

738
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,199
Private number eight and the shooters next to him,

739
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,170
all of you get down.

740
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,174
- Sorry, sir!
- Sorry, sir!

741
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,866
Private number four.

742
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:25,957
Private number four, Kim Yu Jung.

743
00:46:27,229 --> 00:46:28,694
This is your target paper.

744
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:30,415
Gosh, she's terrible.

745
00:46:30,439 --> 00:46:32,125
- What is that?
- What a joke.

746
00:46:32,149 --> 00:46:34,437
- That's so bad.
- Where would you use those skills?

747
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,096
My hand.

748
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,902
- Be quiet.
- You did fine.

749
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,104
She actually did well here.

750
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,306
- What?
- But why?

751
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,556
She might've missed the mark,

752
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,747
but all three shots are clustered together to form a shot group.

753
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:55,008
In this case, if you adjust the sight slightly,

754
00:46:55,129 --> 00:46:57,373
you will be able to hit the mark.

755
00:46:58,379 --> 00:47:00,025
- Go, class president.
- Class president.

756
00:47:00,049 --> 00:47:02,306
- That's impressive.
- Nice one.

757
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,536
There's one person who did a really good job.

758
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,935
Private number 15.

759
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,402
Private number 15, Lee Na Ra.

760
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,346
This is perfect.

761
00:47:14,189 --> 00:47:15,729
All three shots were in the center.

762
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,556
Now, re-adjust accordingly...

763
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,866
and fire again.

764
00:47:28,249 --> 00:47:30,516
- For goodness' sake.
- I don't want to.

765
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,056
You're going to get bad results again.

766
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,697
People who shoot well this time will gain extra points.

767
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:37,856
So focus and fire. All right?

768
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:39,290
How many extra points?

769
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,201
Three points.

770
00:47:42,299 --> 00:47:44,325
- Three?
- Three points?

771
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:46,709
Hurry.

772
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,842
- Get ready.
- Let's go.

773
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:51,454
Let's go.

774
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,217
One shot!

775
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,432
(Class 2-3, Private Yeon Ju)

776
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,058
(Class 1-5, Private Na Ra)

777
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:10,189
One shot.

778
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,520
Two shots.

779
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:15,198
Three shots.

780
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,238
Oh, my gosh.

781
00:48:18,379 --> 00:48:19,567
For goodness' sake.

782
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,025
You still weren't able to make it.

783
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:24,163
- In the middle? Where?
- Just fire.

784
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,656
Dinosaur chicken, spring onion chicken.

785
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,286
- I like them all.
- For goodness' sake!

786
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,410
Why?

787
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,286
- We were saying...
- I'm tired.

788
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:31,729
I can't hear anything.

789
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:32,786
Let's be quiet.

790
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,165
- But I still got three points.
- Oh, my.

791
00:48:35,189 --> 00:48:37,335
- I hope we can get more points.
- Or...

792
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,756
- For goodness' sake.
- I gave up already.

793
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,968
- Let's go here.
- Give up?

794
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,835
You just couldn't make it.

795
00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:44,060
I can't.

796
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,176
Stop! Walk straight.

797
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,256
For goodness' sake.

798
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,184
(We don't sell alcoholic beverages to minors under the age of 18.)

799
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:54,745
- Platoon Two, halt!
- Halt!

800
00:48:57,379 --> 00:48:59,227
Take a ten-minute break at your positions.

801
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:02,037
Take a ten-minute break.

802
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,236
Let's take a break here.

803
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,775
- Have a rest.
- Yes.

804
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:08,956
Sit down.

805
00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:11,690
Don't go far away.

806
00:49:15,439 --> 00:49:17,023
It's the same thing we saw just now.

807
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,665
- Adjusting.
- Why is it here?

808
00:49:19,689 --> 00:49:21,526
- Soon Yi, keep it.
- What?

809
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,286
- Keep it.
- Should I?

810
00:49:23,649 --> 00:49:24,850
- Yes.
- Okay.

811
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,079
Is everything okay?

812
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,191
- Hey.
- What?

813
00:49:36,249 --> 00:49:37,645
Don't you want to drink something cool?

814
00:49:37,669 --> 00:49:40,645
Yes, definitely. I want something sweet too.

815
00:49:40,669 --> 00:49:41,813
- Right?
- Yes.

816
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:44,535
Do you want to go to the convenience store there?

817
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:47,500
Okay.

818
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,966
I'll go check the front just in case.

819
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:07,966
Yes.

820
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,136
Wait while making sure they don't cause any issues.

821
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,348
Yes, sir.

822
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,724
Check for live ammunition.

823
00:50:20,919 --> 00:50:22,019
Live ammunition?

824
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,426
- Check that side.
- Okay.

825
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,140
Excuse me.

826
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:46,753
Hello?

827
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,880
What?

828
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,395
Is there no one here?

829
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:04,401
The door is unlocked.

830
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:07,331
Why are the things all scattered?

831
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,701
I'm starving.

832
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,376
You're so fast.

833
00:51:22,269 --> 00:51:23,468
- There's gum!
- Gum?

834
00:51:25,439 --> 00:51:28,420
They serve bad food. I'll have to bring everything here.

835
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:31,598
Gum.

836
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,477
No way. Cigarettes!

837
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,945
Nice work.

838
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:40,020
- Oh, my gosh.
- This one.

839
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,863
Hey, there's money too.

840
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,942
Right? This is bad, right?

841
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:08,232
- Okay.
- Okay.

842
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:10,959
Gum.

843
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:12,636
Yeon Ju, you'll get better.

844
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,756
- Yes. You'll improve.
- You'll be good.

845
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,846
Gosh, I'm hungry.

846
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,016
Me too. Ms. Park, we're hungry.

847
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,151
I think we'll eat after we go back.

848
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,533
- Where are Tae Man and Hee Rak?
- Yes?

849
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:25,940
Wait.

850
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:29,589
Yu Jung, have you seen Tae Man and Hee Rak?

851
00:52:29,919 --> 00:52:33,782
They were here just now.

852
00:52:33,799 --> 00:52:34,815
Where did they go?

853
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:36,359
Oh, gosh. These boys.

854
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,613
- Platoon sergeant.
- Yes?

855
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,585
Two of the boys are missing. Tae Man and Hee Rak.

856
00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:48,666
What? Since when?

857
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,748
They were here just now.

858
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:52,507
Corporal Park.

859
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:57,545
Two boys broke away.

860
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,966
Check that side. I'll check this side.

861
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,100
Yes.

862
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,806
Don't move and stay here with the students.

863
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,028
All right.

864
00:53:09,709 --> 00:53:12,052
These boys aren't scared at all.

865
00:53:12,919 --> 00:53:14,656
Have you seen Tae Man and Hee Rak?

866
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,775
- No.
- No, I haven't seen them.

867
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:19,196
- You didn't see them, right?
- No one was with them?

868
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,536
Hey, are we going to be punished because of them?

869
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,576
- No way.
- Don't say something terrible!

870
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,250
I'll kill them both.

871
00:53:25,729 --> 00:53:26,786
It's annoying.

872
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:28,185
Ms. Park. I...

873
00:53:32,649 --> 00:53:34,545
I heard them say something about a convenience store.

874
00:53:34,569 --> 00:53:35,636
- What?
- What?

875
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,295
- Convenience store?
- They went to a convenience store?

876
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:39,070
- For goodness' sake.
- Gosh.

877
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,016
- What are they thinking?
- Where's the convenience store?

878
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,556
- Why are they like that?
- I don't know.

879
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,374
Yu Jung, let's go find them.

880
00:54:47,229 --> 00:54:50,286
Gosh, who put their weapon like this?

881
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:53,246
They should be punished. For goodness' sake.

882
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,844
Isn't she Yu Jung?

883
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:04,680
Where are you going?

884
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,056
- What's wrong with her?
- What's going on?

885
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,643
- It's Yu Jung, right?
- Let's follow her.

886
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:12,587
Didn't this fall last time?

887
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:16,533
Why is there nothing?

888
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,110
Gosh.

889
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:24,110
What's wrong?

890
00:55:29,019 --> 00:55:30,165
- What?
- What is it?

891
00:55:30,189 --> 00:55:31,608
- Oh, gosh.
- What is it?

892
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:32,968
- What's that!
- Gosh!

893
00:55:34,939 --> 00:55:36,039
- What's that!
- Gosh!

894
00:55:36,819 --> 00:55:38,788
- Oh, my!
- It's someone's hand!

895
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:40,835
Why is it here?

896
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:41,926
Is it real?

897
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:44,716
- Gosh. What's going on?
- What happened?

898
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:46,214
Is this real?

899
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,453
- Are you okay?
- Look at the nails.

900
00:55:48,999 --> 00:55:50,145
Why did this happen?

901
00:55:50,499 --> 00:55:52,699
- What is this?
- I feel sick.

902
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,294
- What is it?
- I want to throw up.

903
00:55:55,339 --> 00:55:57,077
Is it real?

904
00:55:58,709 --> 00:56:01,791
I want to go home.

905
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,149
Ms. Park!

906
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,553
Don't go. I feel bad about this.

907
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,771
No, Chi Yeol. I'll go and check.

908
00:56:11,689 --> 00:56:13,517
Stay here. Okay?

909
00:56:18,149 --> 00:56:19,350
Ms. Park.

910
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:21,257
Ms. Eun Young!

911
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,731
Don't go. What if it's the spheres?

912
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,892
Young Hoon died because of the spheres too!

913
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,926
- What?
- Young Hoon died? Why?

914
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:31,475
- That idiot.
- I thought he left.

915
00:56:31,499 --> 00:56:32,975
- What is he talking about?
- No way.

916
00:56:32,999 --> 00:56:34,895
Il Ha, what is he talking about?

917
00:56:34,919 --> 00:56:36,725
- Do you know something?
- What's all this, Il Ha?

918
00:56:36,749 --> 00:56:39,237
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know too!

919
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:48,821
Everyone, run!

920
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,613
Oh, my gosh.

921
00:57:35,979 --> 00:57:37,169
No.

922
00:57:39,439 --> 00:57:40,583
No.

923
00:58:03,709 --> 00:58:04,866
Run...

924
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,055
Oh, my gosh!

925
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,081
This is real!

926
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,375
- Oh, my!
- No!

927
00:58:17,399 --> 00:58:18,543
Ms. Park!

928
00:58:18,649 --> 00:58:21,212
Oh, my gosh.

929
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:23,257
What's that?

930
00:58:23,609 --> 00:58:24,753
Run away!

931
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,888
Quick! Run away!

932
00:59:05,189 --> 00:59:06,665
Run faster!

933
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,213
Hurry up and go!

934
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:28,196
- It hurts!
- Hey!

935
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,407
Hey, this way!

936
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,828
No way!

937
00:59:39,729 --> 00:59:42,116
Darn it, what are those things?

938
00:59:43,149 --> 00:59:44,986
- Oh, gosh!
- Let's go.

939
00:59:45,019 --> 00:59:46,625
Kim Yu Jung, what are you doing?

940
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,789
Hey, Yu Jung. Get up.

941
00:59:59,749 --> 01:00:01,036
Are you okay?

942
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:11,463
Save me, please.

943
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,824
Save me.

944
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:16,025
Save me, please.

945
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,826
No, don't go.

946
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,136
What happened to you?

947
01:00:19,729 --> 01:00:20,963
Are you okay?

948
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,569
Well, I...

949
01:01:21,999 --> 01:01:23,556
Lieutenant Lee.

950
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:24,778
What about the others?

951
01:01:29,089 --> 01:01:30,365
What about the others?

952
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:45,995
Guys! Get a hold of yourselves!

953
01:01:46,019 --> 01:01:47,455
Run that way! Hurry!

954
01:01:47,479 --> 01:01:50,053
- Hurry up!
- Hey! Come on!

955

Go.

What on earth are those things?

958
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,576
What about the others?

959
01:02:11,379 --> 01:02:13,449
Darn it, I don't know.

960
01:02:14,209 --> 01:02:15,322
I don't see them.

961
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:23,326
- What are those things?
- Hey, just run!

962
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:24,636
- Run!
- Run!

01:02:36,149 --> 01:02:37,966
- What are you doing?
- Hey, this way.

966
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,177
- This way?
- Okay.

967
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:08,869

You guys need to get your heads on straight, got it?

972
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,205
- Yoo Ha Na!
- Hey, open up!

973
01:04:31,229 --> 01:04:33,205
- Hey, open the door!
- Open up!

974
01:04:33,229 --> 01:04:34,835
- Open the door!
- Ha Na!

975
01:04:34,859 --> 01:04:36,322
- Hey!
- Open the door!

976
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:40,302
- Hey!
- I said open the door!

977
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,458
Go away!

978
01:04:55,669 --> 01:04:58,775
What do I do?

979
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,075
Seriously?

980
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,585
- Darn it.
- Hey, just go!

981
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,740
What do we do now?

982
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:12,452
Darn it.

983
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:17,915
- What on earth is going on?
- I don't know, darn it.

984
01:05:20,569 --> 01:05:22,219
Darn it.

985
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,344
What about Ms. Park?

986
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,321
Where is Ms. Park?

987
01:05:29,370 --> 01:05:32,076
The other kids...

988
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,822
- No...
- Darn it. Seriously...

989
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:47,899
Lieutenant Lee.

990
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:51,990
Go up.

991
01:05:57,979 --> 01:06:00,685
- Are you okay?
- Hey.

992
01:06:00,859 --> 01:06:02,047
Are you okay?

993
01:06:04,359 --> 01:06:07,441
I saw her die, and her hand...

994
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,543
Lieutenant Lee.

995
01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:20,059
What about the others?

998
01:07:05,049 --> 01:07:06,613
I'm so scared.

999
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,605
I think it's okay now.

1000
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,284
Oh, no...

1002
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:12,295
- Ms. Park!
- Yes!

1003
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,506
- No. Okay!
- Come on, Ms. Park.

1004
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,056
- Give us a word.
- Okay.

1005
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,096
Then, don't get hurt.

1006
