00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:08,969
Shoot. We've been walking for two days.

7
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:11,090
And we still have 100km more to go?

8
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:12,469
Gosh.

9
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:16,310
Are you sure we're going the right way?

10
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,060
Yes. It's this way.

11
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,099
I can't feel my feet.

12
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:23,400
I don't think I can walk anymore.

13
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,530
I'm starving.

14
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,699
We're running out of food too.

15
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,870
Wait. There's a car.

This was a sphere's job.

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,129
Shoot.

It's them, isn't it?

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,099

They said they were going to Seoul.

But...

31
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,569

Guys.

37
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,019
We have to go back.

38
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,730
Let's go back and get back to our mission.

39
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,899
Maybe the CSAT isn't canceled.

40
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,949
You can go by yourself if you want to.

42

for those extra points.

44
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,209
We can't just die in vain like them.

45
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,470
Yeon Ju, try and stop them.

46
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,470
They won't listen to me!

Here. Look!

50
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,149
I killed 37 of them!

51
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:13,860
I might even...

52
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,990
get accepted to SNU with these extra points.

53
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,410
Young Soo, are you still hung up on extra points?

54
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,120
You need to stop.

55
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,379
Guys. No.

56
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:35,420
Do you want to get yourselves killed just like them?

57
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,089
No, right?

58
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:39,889

59
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,889

- Awesome. - It's food.

79

They've all gone bad.

80
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,879
Wait. There's food!

81
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,129
And here!

82
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,959
- I found more. - Where?

83

- Yes! - Great job.

84
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,089
- Put them all in. How many? - Here.

85
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,009
- Multiple. There's a lot. - "Multiple?"

Come.

93
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,139

Yes.

the students from the science high school...

They had different opinions,

101
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,500
and only eight of them were going to Seoul.

102
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,500
When I saw their bodies, I thought...

103
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,419
that it might have been us if we had separated.

104
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,549
Yu Jung and Jang Soo weren't wrong, after all.

105
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:53,309
Right.

106
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:58,019
I was furious and felt betrayed at first.

107
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,940
But...

108
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,440
we all know that they were doing their best in their own ways.

120

By the way,

it's been ages since we last came to an amusement park.

126
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,190
It was fun when we went together with the guys in Class One.

127
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:12,779
You're kidding me.

128
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,779
Don't you remember your ex-boyfriend puked...

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:15,990
after riding the pirate ship?

130
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,000
Oh, right. That jerk.

131
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:25,629
We should've gone with our class.

132
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:28,169
Before all this happened.

133
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:32,629
Oh, Soo Chul.

134
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,889
He wanted to go to the amusement park at the beginning of the term.

135
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:40,809
We weren't close back then, so the plan just fizzled out.

136
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,309
I should've just gone with him back then.

137
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,279
- What? - What?

138
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,159
The lights turned on.

139
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:11,419
What's going on?

140
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:19,970
Hey!

141
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,100
I did it!

142
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,139
- Yes. - Oh, my gosh.

143
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,769
- Park So Yoon! - Park So Yoon!

144
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:26,100
- For real? - Amazing.

145
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,350
It was me.

146
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,360
What are you saying? Hey.

147
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,769
- You really... - What are you spouting?

148
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:33,149
Hey.

149
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,399
Let's ride them.

150
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,649
- Really? - Yes, let's.

151
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,279
- Let's ride them. - But I'm scared.

152
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,279
No.

153
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,740
What if the spheres appear?

154
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,500
There aren't any around the area.

155
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,460
Wouldn't it be okay as long as we don't scream?

156
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,629
- He's right. - Yes.

157
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,590
- Let's ride them. - I'm in.

158
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,460
- Come on. - Let's ride them.

159
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,090
Of course, I'll ride them.

160
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,509
By the way,

161
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,720
it's beautiful, isn't it?

162
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:07,179
For real. Let's try it.

163
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,190
Gosh, seriously.

164
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,200
No!

165
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,250
We're flying!

166
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Stop!

167
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,980
(All cars need a minimum of 2 people.)

168
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,870
Yes, spin!

169
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,289
Oh, no.

170
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,259
Duk Joong! So Yeon!

171
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,549
Hey! What the heck?

172
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,629
- Get on. - Come on.

173
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,009
Hold tight.

174
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:24,429
- Gosh. - Save me!

175
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:41,200
Now then, it is the long-awaited final round.

176
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,409
Who will be named the best sharpshooter?

177
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:46,450
(Shoot the pretty doll down, and it's yours!)

178
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,200
Na Ra!

179
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:53,710
- Lee Na Ra! - Lee Na Ra!

180
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,710
Next.

181
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,210
Bo Ra!

182
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:00,419
- Yeon Bo Ra! - Yeon Bo Ra!

183
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,799
- Yeon Bo Ra! - Yeon Bo Ra!

184
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:03,929
Yeon Bo Ra!

185
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:06,639
Get ready.

186
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:09,100
Fire.

187
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,480
Look.

188
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,100
- For real? - Oh, my gosh.

189
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,940
- Yeon Bo Ra! - Yeon Bo Ra!

190
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,399
- Na Ra! - Oh, no.

191
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,860
Gosh, Na Ra!

192
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,950
(Shooting Range, Baseball Pitcher, Balloon Darts)

193
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,700
- Bo Ra! - Na Ra!

194
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,909
Are they kids or what?

195
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:29,740
Why are they going all out in a game?

196
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,909
- They're so childish. - I know, right?

197
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,080
What do you think?

198
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,120
- Ta-da! - Ta-da!

199
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:38,419
- Hi, darn it. - Look.

200
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,549
I don't know who's childish now.

201
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:44,720
They're a lost cause. Don't you agree?

202
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,600
Darn it. This isn't the time to have fun.

203
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,399
They're mad. They completely lost it.

204
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,880
Darn it.

205
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,509
I haven't been studying for days now. Will I be okay?

206
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,339
What if I forgot all of it?

207
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,220
Let's see.

208
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,849
A squared is B squared plus C squared...

209
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,599
minus one. 2bc...

210
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:35,390
Cosine...

211
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:38,019
Come on. Remember it.

212
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,859
Again.

213
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:43,400
B squared is A squared plus C squared...

214
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,529
minus A...

215
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:45,900
Are you even studying now?

216
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:47,990
Why not hang out with the others?

217
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,369
Let's go relieve our stress.

218
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,369
Darn it.

219
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:53,369
Is this really the time to do that?

220
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,160
Have you all gone crazy?

221
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:57,160
We should hurry up and check...

222
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,539
if the CSAT is really canceled.

223
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,170
I get that you're upset.

224
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,880
But just accept it.

225
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
And we'll probably take the CSAT next year.

226
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,630
Think of it as studying for another year.

227
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
"Another year?"

228
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:18,809
That scumbag.

229
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,150
Only jerks like you have another chance.

230
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,900
You might have academies and private tutors.

231
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,109
But I can't even afford to go to an academy.

232
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,819
How could you say that so easily?

233
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:35,740
You started it.

234
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,750
What did I do? You always blame me.

235
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,789
You should've kept quiet.

236
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:40,539
- Move it. - She's here.

237
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,250
Bo Ra.

238
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,130
It's okay. Losing is no big deal.

239
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,720
- Seriously? - It hurts. Why did you hit me?

240
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:50,089
Go ahead and tell her.

241
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:52,299
Over there. There are darts too.

242
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,599
How about a revenge match?

243
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:56,930
- Go for it. - Let's do it.

244
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:00,099
No, I'm good.

245
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:02,650
- What is it, Bo Ra? - Bo Ra!

246
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,150
- Bo Ra! - Bo Ra's sulking!

247
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,230
- Bo Ra, wait for me. - It's okay.

248
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,779
- Take the darts. - Yeon Bo Ra.

249
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,359
- Yeon Bo Ra! - Yeon Bo Ra!

250
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,950
- That's nice. - Yeon Bo Ra!

251
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,069
Yes! What?

252
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:16,539
- Let's go. - Yes, come on.

253
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,500
- You'll definitely win. - He's right.

254
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,750
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

255
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,829
- Shoot! - Do it.

256
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:23,130
Don't worry. It's okay. Try it again.

257
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,420
I fought with Soo Chul at the hospital.

258
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,380
Yeon Bo Ra! A mistake is okay.

259
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,420
What?

260
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:32,549
Are you crazy?

261
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,009
Why did you bring this here?

262
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,349
You should've gotten rid of it.

263
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:36,809
I forgot to burn it.

264
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,349
How could you forget that?

265
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,309
What if the guys find out we swapped it?

266
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,769
Darn it. I've had enough.

267
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,690
What?

268
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,569
Deceiving the guys. I can't do it anymore.

269
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,150
So what? Should we come clean?

270
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,569
Do you think they'll be understanding?

271
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:53,700
I don't know, darn it.

272
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,160
Either way, this feels wrong.

273
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,329
Then what? Go back like this?

274
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,160
Should we run away? Is that it?

275
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:05,579
Darn it.

276
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Hey.

277
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,009
You look mental these days.

278
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,890
Come to your senses.

279
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,759
Is someone in there?

280
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,150
Why?

281
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:33,740
I just thought I heard something.

282
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,200
Were you with someone?

283
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,779
No, I was alone.

284
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:40,450
Oh, I see.

285
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:43,210
He died because of me.

286
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:47,539
Young Hoon also died because of me.

287
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,799
Do friends who get close to me die?

288
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,019
Am I an unlucky punk?

289
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,849
Hey.

290
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:09,190
Did you call those things?

291
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,359
What?

292
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:13,900
Did you call the spheres?

293
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,660
Did you make us fight the spheres?

294
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,700
(Bumper Car)

295
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,829
You didn't.

296
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:24,910
Young Hoon and Soo Chul...

297
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,000
didn't die because of you.

298
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,089
It's not because of you...

299
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,470
or anyone of us.

300
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,509
Why did I live so foolishly?

301
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,059
Gosh.

302
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,019
We're all fools.

303
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,859
We just signed the consent form as we were told.

304
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,730
Goodness.

305
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:03,700
(Bumper Car)

306
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,130
Why are you hesitating?

307
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,470
Just break it and take it. Nobody will know anyway.

308
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:26,140
You really are frustrating.

309
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:50,750
I was keeping it to smoke it on my way home...

310
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,880
after everything was over.

311
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,130
Don't tell anyone.

312
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:55,750
Especially Kwon Il Ha.

313
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:04,140
I used to hate people who inconvenience others...

314
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,559
the most in the world.

315
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,230
My dad was like that.

316
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,769
That's why seeing you always irritated me.

317
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:16,859
But I was wrong.

318
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,779
It's not an inconvenience.

319
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,069
To be fair, it's normal for you to be slow at assembling a gun...

320
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,700
and be bad at shooting a gun.

321
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,710
Freezing when you see a monster.

322
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,539
Not being able to pass someone by when they're asking to be saved.

323
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,710
That's normal.

324
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,640
Why? Is what I'm saying all too obvious?

325
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,140
I don't know what I'm saying either.

326
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,109
I'm good at shooting now.

327
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,779
Yes, you're good at shooting a gun.

328
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,490
You know I'm a bit better though, right?

329
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:05,779
Yes.

330
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,180
We wanted to take it with you. How disloyal of you.

331
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,720
You can't leave Duk Joong out during photo time.

332
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:32,769
- Exactly. Let's go. - Go.

333
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:33,769
Wait up!

334
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:34,940
Should we go too?

335
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,609
Sure.

336
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,319
- Let's take it. One, two. - Come on.

337
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,569
- Are we all in there? - One, two, three.

338
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:43,609
- Come here. - Let's go.

339
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:44,950
- Yes! - Hey.

- Get out. - Nice.

- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

- Okay! - Okay!

347
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:58,000
- Oh, goodness. - Oh, my.

348

- Look at that. - What is that?

Gosh. Kim Duk Joong.

- He does look cute. - It turned out well.

358
00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:19,150
We should all take one together.

359
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,019
- Sounds nice. - That sounds nice.

360
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,730
- That sounds very nice. - Seriously.

361
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,150
- Okay. - Let's take one.

362
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,609
Do you think we can all fit?

363
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,410
- It is a bit small. - That's true.

364
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,079
Chi Yeol. We can take it with your camcorder.

365

- That's true. - Good idea.

366

Guys. You're all in, right?

370
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:43,170
- Let's go. - Wait.

371
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,049
Where's Jang Soo and So Yeon?

372
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:48,390
Right. Young Soo's not here either.

373
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,849
Whatever. Let's take one and find them after.

374

Chi Yeol. Are you ready?

375
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,470
Okay. One, two, three.

377
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,190
Wait a second.

378
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,690
I have to clean out my memory card. Sorry.

379

00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:03,900
- Hurry up. - Come on.

381
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,690

382
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:07,029

Why?

386
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,460
First, I'll convince Mom somehow.

387
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,259
No.

388
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,180
Retaking it won't do anything.

389
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:31,759
I'll get caught up anyway.

390
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,390
I won't be able to go to college. I'll be a failure forever.

391
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:39,230
I'll end up like Mom and Dad.

392

It's not canceled!

398
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:03,170

Gosh. Look!

What are you doing here alone?

402
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,119
Why are you standing watch here all by yourself?

403
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:35,950
Are you trying to show what a good student you are?

404
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,049
Sorry.

405

When we were in school,

we had to study for the CSAT, study until late at night,

430

To do so, I need to get rid of all of them.

Those spheres. I'm going to get rid of them all.

439
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:25,640
Those spheres that killed Woo Taek and Mr. Lee.

440
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:29,180
All of them.

441
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,559
Oh, no!

442
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,109
Take that!

443
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,220

No!

That's a relief.

447
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,160
I get it.

448
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,619
I get what you mean.

00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:11,950
You scared me.

The decision to cancel the CSAT has been withdrawn.

456
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:31,140
If we leave the operation area, that's considered desertion, right?

457
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,480
That means all of the certificates we received so far are all gone.

458
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:37,190
So we need to tell everyone and go back to the operation area.

459
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:42,859
Where are you going?

460
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:49,200
This is an old newspaper.

461
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:50,700
Get it together.

462
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:52,579
What?

463
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,789
Really? I definitely saw it earlier.

464
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:07,549
I definitely saw it earlier.

465
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,469
Hey. I know you're obsessed with going to college,

466
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,559
but how can you still talk about the CSAT in this situation?

467
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,690
No. I saw it earlier.

468
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,150
But I must've dropped it on my way here.

469
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,739
The CSAT hasn't been canceled.

470
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,449
Really.

471
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,159
Let go.

472
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,039
You want to follow Mr. Lee's words, don't you?

473
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,340
If so, we should see this operation through to the end.

474
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,469
Let go. You're hurting me.

475
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,179
Let go of me.

476
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,719
Why do you keep avoiding me?

477
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,059
Why?

478
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,099
Do I smell? Do I?

479
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,860
I'm better than Cho Jang Soo.

480
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,780
If I go to a better school than Cho Jang Soo,

481
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,360
I can treat you even better.

482
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,780
Are you crazy?

483
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,570
What kind of nonsense is that?

484
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:13,949
You don't know the seriousness of this situation.

485
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:19,159
I saw you and Cho Jang Soo kissing.

486
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,869
Is this the time to be kissing and playing around?

487
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,039
What are you saying?

488
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,300
Let go. Let go of me, you crazy bastard!

489
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:37,059
So Yeon.

490
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,980
So Yeon.

491
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,110
So Yeon.

492
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
So Yeon.

493
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,280
So Yeon.

494
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,110
So Yeon. Wake up, So Yeon. Please?

495
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,409
So Yeon. Open your eyes. So Yeon.

496
00:35:58,869 --> 00:35:59,949
Oh, no.

497
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,130
So Yeon. I was wrong. I'm sorry.

498
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,380
Please open your eyes, So Yeon.

499
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,510
Please open your eyes, So Yeon.

500
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:21,519
You pervert.

501
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,730
What is this smell? I keep smelling the spheres.

502
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,940
Their peculiar fishy smell.

503
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,539
You wench.

504
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,670
You think you're better than me?

505
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:47,380
Why do you look down on me?

506
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,420
Why don't you trust what I say?

507
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,309
Hey.

508
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,650
So Yeon.

509
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
So Yeon?

510
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,949
Cha So Yeon.

511
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,019
Gosh. What am I doing?

512
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,940
Straighten up, Kwon Il Ha.

513
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,320
What is he doing?

514
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,829
Goodness.

515
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,170
Are you crazy? I saw everything, you punk.

516
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,170
- Gosh. Are you insane? - Saw what?

517
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,800
She passed out, so I was just helping her.

518
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,469
Don't be ridiculous, you jerk.

519
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:23,719
Goodness. What's wrong with you?

520
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,230
What's wrong with her?

521
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,400
- Did you do this? - No! It wasn't me!

522
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,489
Goodness.

523
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:42,829
Cha So Yeon. Are you okay? Open your eyes.

524
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:44,159
Goodness.

525
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,789
What's wrong with you?

526
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,250
Hey, Cha So Yeon.

527
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,670
Oh, no. What do I do?

528
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,300
What am I supposed to do? Hey, Cha So Yeon.

529
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:00,760
Cha So Yeon.

530
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,309
- What are you doing? - Are you going to tell?

531
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,940
Are you going to tell the others?

532
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,110
- If I do, what are you going to do? - Don't tell.

533
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,610
If you do, I'll kill you.

534
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,239
If you tell them, my life is over.

535
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,699
I can't end it like this.

536
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:27,449
- What? - Gosh. Don't tell them!

537
00:39:28,289 --> 00:39:30,329
- Because of you, I... - Okay.

538
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:32,750
Okay. I won't tell them.

539
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,460
Really?

540
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,800
Yes. Really.

541
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:54,269
- Goodness, this punk. - Oh, no!

542
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:02,530
- Punk. - Oh, no.

543
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,659
- Jerk. - Oh, no.

544
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,380
Oh, Cha So Yeon. Are you awake?

545
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:25,510
It's me, Il Ha. Open your eyes!

546
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,849
Cha So Yeon.

547
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:30,599
Cha So Yeon!

548
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,019
Cha So Yeon.

549
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,440
You punk!

550
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,900
Goodness.

551
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:47,829
- Yes! - Oh, my.

552
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:50,329
- Let's go! - How nice.

553
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:51,619
You won't join us?

554
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:52,789
Right?

555
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:54,869
- Come on, Jang Soo. - Get on.

556
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,750
- Come and play. - Hi, Jang Soo.

557
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,170
- Hi. - Get on a horse.

558
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,800
- Cho Jang Soo. Come on. - Come over here!

559
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,010
Why did we choose such a boring ride for the finale?

560
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,969
Why? It's not that bad.

561
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,349
We're going in circles, so no one wins...

562
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:11,849
or gets overtaken.

563
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,599
What?

564
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,650
Cho Young Sin, you're pretty cool.

565
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,820
We're going in circles.

566
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,070
No one wins.

567
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:25,280
Or gets overtaken.

568
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:27,530
- Hey. - What?

569
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:29,030
Darn it.

570
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,579
No. I will overtake you.

571
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,789
Let's go, mustang! Giddy-up!

572
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,880
Go!

573
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,460
I won't let you.

574
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,170
Go, my trusted steed!

575
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,219
Giddy-up!

576
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,760
Go!

577
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,889
- Wait. - What was that?

578
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:50,429
What was that sound?

579
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:52,349
- A gun? - It was gunshots.

580
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,429
What happened?

581
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:12,489
- So Yeon. - So Yeon!

582
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:15,329
So Yeon.

583
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,710
So Yeon, wake up!

584
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,420
- Hey! - What happened?

585
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,800
What happened to So Yeon?

586
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,670
What happened?

587
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,880
- What happened, So Yeon? - There's blood!

588
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,010
Oh, no.

589
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,969
So Yeon. Cha So Yeon!

590
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,349
- So Yeon. - Blood...

591
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,519
A sphere...

592
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:46,860
A sphere...

593
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,489
- A sphere attacked. - What?

594
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:51,989
So, a sphere...

595
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:54,239
A sphere...

596
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,289
A sphere suddenly attacked us.

597
00:42:57,619 --> 00:42:59,329
- A sphere? - Where is it?

598
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:00,369
Where is it?

599
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,539
Be on guard!

600
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,170
Darn it.

601
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,380
A sphere attacked So Yeon?

602
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,469
No, what happened was,

603
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:14,139
So Yeon suddenly collapsed.

604
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:17,639
And a sphere tried to take her,

605
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,559
so Il Ha tried to stop it,

606
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:24,150
and the sphere dragged him into the water.

607
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,530
What are you talking about? Get your story straight!

608
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,320
Where's the sphere?

609
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,780
- It's over there. - What's he on about?

610
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,989
Wait. Spheres are coming.

611
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:38,949
What?

612
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,420
There's a ton of them.

613
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:44,789
What?

614
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,210
So Yeon.

615
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,550
- So Yeon. - Get up.

616
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:50,969
- Shoot. - What do we do?

617
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,800
Did our noise attract them?

618
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,139
Darn it.

619
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:56,219
Kwon Il Ha.

620
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:58,599
- We have to go. - What about Il Ha?

621
00:43:58,599 --> 00:43:59,769
We can't save him.

622
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:02,230
He'll be dead by now.

623
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,820
Pull yourself together and answer me!

624
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,400
Where's Il Ha?

625
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,699
I'm so sorry, I tried to stop it.

626
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:13,739
It was so fast and I couldn't do anything.

627
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:15,030
Sorry, my bad.

628
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:16,619
What are you talking about?

629
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,000
Kwon Il Ha!

630
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:24,380
Kwon Il Ha!

631
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,539
Kwon Il Ha!

632
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,550
Il Ha!

633
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,050
- Il Ha. - I tried to save him.

634
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,599
The water was so dark.

635
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,219
- It was so dark and I... - Young Soo.

636
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,559
Take your time. Start at the beginning.

637
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:46,150
The water was so dark.

638
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,820
I couldn't see anything.

639
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,190
I saw what looked like Il Ha, so I tried to grab him.

640
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,530
- It was so slippery and... - Guys, let's go!

641
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,360
We must go!

642
00:44:54,989 --> 00:44:57,280
- So Yeon. Get up. - Wake up, So Yeon.

643
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,699
- You need to get up. - Come on.

644
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:01,369
Darn it.

645
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:03,829
So Yeon!

646
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:05,670
- We have to go. - Are you okay?

647
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,670
Are you awake?

648
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,250
- Let's move it. - So Yeon's awake.

649
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,750
- Get moving! - So Yeon.

650
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,300
- Wait! - Let's go!

651
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:15,010
Can we please wait?

652
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:16,550
- Darn it. - Wait!

653
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,800
Let's go!

654
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,260
Oh, whatever.

655
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:21,599
(Official Test Track)

656
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,179
Hurry up!

657
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,480
Kook Young Soo!

658
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,190
- Let's go. - Young Soo, hurry.

659
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,489
What should we do now?

660
00:46:22,829 --> 00:46:24,500
Gosh...

661
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:28,369
Kwon Il Ha, that jerk.

662
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,920
We have to go.

663
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:31,349
So Yeon. Are you okay?

664
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:33,190
Can you walk?

665
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,900
Yes. I'm okay.

666
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,320
Hang in there.

667
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:42,570
We have to go a little further.

668
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:46,039
Can you not remember anything?

669
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:47,909
The accident.

670
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:55,920
She's concussed.

671
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,960
She needs to go indoors and rest.

672
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,130
Will she get better after a while?

673
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,719
It's not serious, is it?

674
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,719
I'm not sure.

675
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:05,929
A light concussion shouldn't last.

676
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:08,349
So Yeon, tell me if you're too tired.

677
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:50,219
Guys, I don't think we can go any further.

678
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:52,480
The detector isn't catching anything,

679
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:54,519
so let's spend the night there.

680
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,489
Are you okay, So Yeon?

681
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:28,679
Are you okay?

682
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:39,400
The detector didn't detect any spheres.

683
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,440
Darn it.

684
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:46,530
We left Il Ha behind.

685
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:57,289
Do you think he swam to safety?

686
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,130
Is there...

687
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,760
Is there a slight possibility?

688
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:15,389
Let's look for him in the morning.

689
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:19,610
Yes. Let's find his body at least.

690
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,190
It could be floating.

691
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,900
No way. It can't be.

692
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,949
I weighed him down with rocks. They can't find him.

693
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:33,239
Yes.

694
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:35,750
It's not right to just leave.

695
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,789
What should we tell...

696
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,500
his parents?

697
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,469
What if his body is floating?

698
00:50:49,929 --> 00:50:53,099
If they see the gunshot wounds, they'll know I shot him.

699
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:58,889
Let's not split up ever again.

700
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,480
I really...

701
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,690
don't want to lose anyone else.

702
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:56,619
Darn it. What should I do?

703
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:59,159
Did I do that bad a thing?

704
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,369
He tried to shoot me.

705
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,170
It was self-defense.

706
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,880
If I didn't shoot him, he'd have shot me.

707
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:12,800
Even if we made it,

708
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:16,219
my life would end if he told people what I'd done.

709
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:22,269
I did it to survive, didn't I?

710
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,599
To survive.

711
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,280
The scumbag.

712
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,909
He bullied and annoyed me for ages.

713
00:52:34,409 --> 00:52:37,030
It was my luck we were in the same class for two years.

714
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:40,619
I wouldn't have to see him again once we graduated!

715
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:43,750
He'd only get into a college that had openings left.

716
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:46,079
It's better for society...

717
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:48,420
if I were to survive and not the likes of him.

718
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,550
Right?

719
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,760
It's that witch Cha So Yeon's fault.

720
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:58,679
She looks down on me.

721
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,650
My gosh.

722
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,949
Darn it.

723
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:21,449
Kook Young Soo.

724
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,960
Stay there! Don't come closer!

725
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,460
Don't come nearer.

726
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,670
How does it feel to be a murderer?

727
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:34,840
Now everyone will know.

728
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,889
And you'll be screwed.

729
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:41,179
I knew you'd end up like this.

730
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:44,139
You pathetic loser.

731
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,090
Darn it.

732
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,679
What? Young Soo?

733
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,099
It can't be.

734
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,269
- But... - But what?

735
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:26,980
What is it?

736
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,480
Did you see something?

737
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,230
Kook Young Soo.

738
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:37,739
He acted weird.

739
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:43,079
He talked crap about the CSAT happening.

740
00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:46,199
I tried to get away.

741
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,250
Let go.

742
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,500
Let go of me, you crazy bastard!

743
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,670
When I woke up,

744
00:54:58,550 --> 00:54:59,840
I saw Il Ha.

745
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:01,260
It's me, Il Ha.

746
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:02,800
Open your eyes!

747
00:55:03,309 --> 00:55:05,059
That's all I remember.

748
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:09,440
When I woke up again,

749
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,059
you were around me.

750
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:14,110
But...

751
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,230
the spheres...

752
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:19,949
There weren't any.

753
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,869
What?

754
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,199
Are you sure?

755
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:26,789
Darn it.

756
00:55:31,789 --> 00:55:33,420
I don't know what happened.

757
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:39,010
So Yeon. You should rest.

758
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:42,469
Get some rest, then take your time later...

759
00:55:43,429 --> 00:55:44,510
to think.

760
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:47,389
And...

761
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,099
until then,

762
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:52,440
let's not...

763
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,860
suspect Young Soo too rashly.

764
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,530
Okay?

765
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:02,860
Let's go.

766
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,690
(Raising happy and caring talent)

767
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:40,610
Why did we come into Class 3-2?

768
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,530
Whose idea was it?

769
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:46,239
You're right.

770
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:51,000
I just noticed we're sitting in our usual seats.

771
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:53,960
We are.

772
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:57,380
I took my spot without thinking.

773
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:02,010
Soo Chul used to sit in front of me.

774
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,389
In Hye sat next to me.

775
00:57:08,389 --> 00:57:09,559
Young Hoon sat here.

776
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:10,849
Darn it.

777
00:57:11,809 --> 00:57:13,269
I'm alone in the back.

778
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,519
It feels weird.

779
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,860
It almost feels like...

780
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,650
Il Ha will barge in with a curse.

781
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:25,989
Don't you think they just went home?

782
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:28,869
In Hye,

783
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:32,079
Woo Taek, Soo Chul, Il Ha.

784
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:34,460
That they're not dead.

785
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,210
That we'll see them all again back at school.

786
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,500
Yes.

787
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,090
Sitting around like this...

788
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,590
makes it feel like we're in school.

789
00:57:50,179 --> 00:57:51,929
I want to go back.

790
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:54,429
Me too. I wish we could go back in time.

791
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:55,769
Me too.

792
00:57:55,769 --> 00:57:59,110
Then I'll invent a time machine.

793
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:01,230
What?

794
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:02,230
Who, you?

795
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,360
First, I must get into KAIST.

796
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:05,650
Seoul National University?

797
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:07,449
That would be better.

798
00:58:07,449 --> 00:58:09,280
- As if. - You?

799
00:58:09,699 --> 00:58:11,409
- Good luck. - Good luck.

800
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,659
I'll take that to go back in time,

801
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,789
and stop my parents from signing the consent form.

802
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,789
- Me too. I'll never sign it. - No.

803
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:21,840
Not ever.

804
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:23,340
Never.

805
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,960
- Gosh, no. - Never ever.

806
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,019
I remembered something.

807
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:42,110
- What? - What?

808
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,230
What is it?

809
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:47,239
Young Soo...

810
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,360
killed Il Ha.

811
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,489
- What? - What?

812
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:51,530
- Young Soo... - For real?

813
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,159
tried to sexually assault So Yeon.

814
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:55,119
- What? - No way.

815
00:58:55,329 --> 00:58:56,619
- Hey! - Where is he?

816
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:58,119
- For real? - Find him!

817
00:58:58,119 --> 00:58:59,460
- What a jerk! - Oh, gosh.

818
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,829
- How could he? - Darn him!

819
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,250
- Let's kill him. - Hey.

820
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:03,460
Don't stop me!

821
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,460
- He's a psycho! - Let's get him!

822
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,760
Don't get so upset. Calm down.

823
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,219
The bastard!

824
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:10,840
- How could he? - Get him.

825
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,219
Let's do something.

826
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:13,219
Keep still!

827
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:14,809
- The bastard. - Let's kill the jerk!

828
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:16,139
What a bastard!

829
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:18,269
- We must do something! - Darn it.

830
00:59:19,019 --> 00:59:20,900
Screw it. What do I do now?

831
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,360
What should I do?

832
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,280
I just wanted to survive.

833
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,989
I should've killed So Yeon sooner. The witch.

834
00:59:32,449 --> 00:59:35,079
Darn it. I'm doomed.

835
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:36,159
Shoot.

836
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,019
Spheres...

837
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,320
The spheres...

838
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,329
Guys.

839
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:18,699
What do you want to do when you go home?

840
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:25,590
The first thing I'll do is soak in a hot bath.

841
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,250
And wash myself thoroughly.

842
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,840
I'll feel clean and refreshed.

843
01:00:31,469 --> 01:00:34,139
I bet all the dirt will clog your sewer.

844
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,679
Yours will be worse.

845
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:38,519
You could make an eraser with your dirt.

846
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:40,809
Darn it.

847
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:44,230
I think...

848
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:45,980
once I go home,

849
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:49,110
I'll forget everything else and sleep.

850
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:54,449
I'll treat my parents better...

851
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,909
without getting so annoyed.

852
01:00:55,909 --> 01:00:56,949
Me too.

853
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:00,750
I always got told off for using my phone too much.

854
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,250
Now I've realized that I can live without it.

855
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,539
I'll talk a lot with my parents when I go home.

856
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,880
That sounds nice.

857
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,800
I miss my mom.

858
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:15,889
What'll happen when we go home?

859
01:01:16,469 --> 01:01:17,639
Who knows.

860
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:20,969
Will we be able...

861
01:01:21,889 --> 01:01:24,440
to return to our normal lives?

862
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,440
Things will be a bit different.

863
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,780
Maybe our parents...

864
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,530
will stop nagging at us to study and get into good universities.

865
01:01:37,449 --> 01:01:38,449
No way.

866
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:42,199
Gosh, I wanted to get a nose job before going to university.

867
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,659
- Hey! - Hello there.

868
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:48,539
Ms. So Yeon. In my opinion, even if you have a higher nose,

869
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:51,300
your other features... I doubt your nose is the issue here.

870
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,969
And your own face? Do you want a beating?

871
01:01:53,969 --> 01:01:55,219
I'm tired of this relationship.

872
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,389
Me too.

873
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:02,269
When I go to university, I'll slack for a few months without studying.

874
01:02:02,809 --> 01:02:06,519
I'll have fun going to blind dates and field trips.

875
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:09,230
I'll let loose by trying everything.

876
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,480
Aren't you the only senior who enjoys himself freely?

877
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,860
Don't act like you've been restrained.

878
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,570
As a senior, I'm trying to enjoy despite the stress.

879
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:19,909
I'll be free and happy in university. It's not the same.

880
01:02:19,909 --> 01:02:20,989
- That's right. - Come on.

881
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:25,159
After all we've been through, how can you still think of college?

882
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:26,659
I know, right?

883
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:30,630
In any case, I hope we go back to Seoul soon.

884
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:33,670
I'm sick of this...

885
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:36,219
and hope the stupid war ends soon.

886
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:39,010
- Gosh. - I'm so sick of it.

887
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:40,179
Goodness.

888
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,559
If we get to go back to Seoul,

889
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,599
no matter...

890
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:50,019
what happens when we're back,

891
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,320
let's have faith in each other...

892
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,650
and protect one another.

893
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:00,449
Okay.

894
01:03:10,539 --> 01:03:13,460
- I'll be nicer to you. - Me too.

895
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:18,219
By the way, where's Young Soo?

896
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,840
- Is he in the toilet? - Beats me.

897
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:25,059
I haven't seen him for some time. Where did he go?

898
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:29,889
I'll look for him. We should also take turns keeping watch.

899
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,269
- Okay. - Let's do that.

900
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,650
- He said to take turns. - Keep watch.

901
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,190
- I'll go. - My gloves are all wet.

902
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:39,739
- Gosh. - Ae Seol, let's go.

903
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,329
Jang Soo!

904
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:49,000
No, stop!

905
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:53,289
The guns! Get your guns!

906
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:16,480
Gosh, Chi Yeol. Had a sweet dream?

907
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:18,530
- Where are the guys? - What about them?

908
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:26,030
- We have to go soon. - Do that again.

909
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,159
- One more time. - What was that?

910
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,659
- My goodness. - Stop that!

911
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:34,630
- Oh, my goodness! - My gosh.

912
01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:36,380
- What is this? - What are you looking at?

913
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,460
What's that?

914
01:04:41,969 --> 01:04:44,969
- Oh, my. - No way.

915
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:49,679
- Catch me. - Gosh.

916
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:51,769
Chi Yeol, are you still half-asleep?

917
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:55,230
Why do you look so dazed and silly?

918
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,019
Oh.

919
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,280
I must've dozed off by accident.

920
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:05,739
Accident, my foot. Wipe your saliva first.

921
01:05:07,659 --> 01:05:10,949
My, it smells nice and musty.

922
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:13,789
Hey, what happened?

923
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:15,079
Is the war...

924
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:18,380
over?

925
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,090
What about the spheres?

926
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:24,630
Chi Yeol.

927
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:28,389
What nonsense are you spouting?

928
01:05:29,469 --> 01:05:30,469
Oh, dear.

929
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:34,440
I mean...

930
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:38,650
- I had a strange dream. - What kind of strange dream?

931
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:41,690
We were hunted by spheres.

932
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:43,949
But...

933
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,829
I'm glad that everyone's alive.

934
01:05:48,829 --> 01:05:51,869
Gosh. I'm even more glad for you.

935
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:53,409
Seriously, poor you.

936
01:05:53,409 --> 01:05:55,670
Left, left, right!

937
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:57,460
Hey, that's mine.

938
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:00,880
- Seriously, Im Woo Taek! - It's not me.

939
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,920
Hey, Chi Yeol.

940
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:05,719
Kim Chi Yeol.

941
01:06:09,389 --> 01:06:10,510
Kim Chi Yeol!

942
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:12,849
Wake up, Chi Yeol.

943
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,809
Chi Yeol, please.

944
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:28,110
Wake up, please.

945
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:38,460
Come on, Kim Duk Joong. Please.

946
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:47,550
Duk Joong!

947
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:50,219
Wake up, please.

948
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:54,769
Wake up. I'm begging you.

949
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:56,679
Let's go.

950
01:06:57,230 --> 01:07:00,690
Come with me. Please.

951
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:04,730
Duk Joong, please wake up.

952
01:07:10,409 --> 01:07:11,949
Oh, my goodness!

953
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:16,619
- Jang Soo! - No!

954
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:18,920
Jang Soo.

955
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,500
I'm sorry.

956
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,800
But I have to go to university.

957
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:34,179
Oh, my!

958
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:36,099
- What? - Young Soo, please.

959
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:38,309
How could you...

960
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:44,650
It was you.

961
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,119
Chi Yeol!

962
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,789
- Please! - Oh, no.

963
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,179
Hurry, run!

964
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,220
Come on!

965
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,819
You bastard!

966
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,319
Please!

967
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:47,250
My gosh.

968
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,010
Help.

969
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:54,800
Wake up, Chi Yeol.

970
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:58,510
Chi Yeol, please.

971
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:10,109
Bo Ra.

972
01:09:12,489 --> 01:09:13,779
Come on.

973
01:09:15,949 --> 01:09:18,409
Go. Run away, quick.

974
01:09:19,949 --> 01:09:21,369
Please go.

975
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:23,539
Bo Ra, please don't.

976
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:26,750
Duk Joong.

977
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,920
Wake up, please. Wake up.

978
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,840
Duk Joong. I'm begging you.

979
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:35,510
I can't.

980
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,930
Please go already.

981
01:09:45,729 --> 01:09:46,729
Bo Ra.

982
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:49,479
Bo Ra.

983
01:10:02,829 --> 01:10:05,289
Please, don't.

984
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,170
Don't.

985
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,920
Help! Stop it.

986
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,840
I'm sorry. Please spare me.

987
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,130
This isn't like you, right?

988
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:19,180
Please, I beg you.

989
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:24,310
Will we go?

990
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:27,399
Yes, let's go home together.

991
01:10:27,399 --> 01:10:30,020
It'll be all right. Let's go home together,

992
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,649
Young Soo.

993
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:49,380
No!

994
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:12,109
No...

995
01:11:12,109 --> 01:11:15,029
Stop it. Young Soo! Please.

996
01:11:15,149 --> 01:11:18,819
Come on. Why are you doing this?

997
01:11:19,489 --> 01:11:22,449
Put the gun down. I beg you.

998
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,579
Please come to your senses!

999
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,590
I didn't want to do this either.

1000
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,880
I wished I could have...

1001
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:40,220
a future to dream of.

1002
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,100
I had no choice.

1003
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,390
This darn war...

1004
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,939
ruined my life.

1005
01:11:58,399 --> 01:11:59,489
It's all ruined.

1006
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:01,779
It's all over!

1007
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,420
I'm sorry.

1008
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,010
What should I do?

1009
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
We made...

1010
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,130
a promise.

1011
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:15,470
I'm sorry.

1012
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:19,399
Sorry, everyone.

1013
01:15:25,069 --> 01:15:26,399
I'm so sorry.

1014
01:15:36,289 --> 01:15:38,710

The controversy over extra points for CSAT related to serving duty...

hasn't settled yet, and CSAT will still be held.

in less than two months, they developed a new weapon,

and ridiculously, only in a few weeks,

1044

Almost all the spheres which we risked our lives against...

1045

were eliminated.

why did we have to fight it?

Did I really need extra points?

Why did I want to go to college?

1058

It's just that everyone goes there.

1059

I might be left behind if I don't go to college.

1060
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:45,729
What I learned from the painful war...

1061
01:18:46,979 --> 01:18:49,020
was something they don't teach at school.

1062

To survive, you don't need to beat your friend next to you.

1063
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:56,779
You have to help out...

wasn't CSAT or going to college.

However, after all,

1069

1072
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:28,810
wasn't spheres,

1073

The girls will go mad if they find this out.

Hello, Ms. Choi!

01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:00,359
Are you entering a beauty pageant?

Are you in a fight or what?

1151
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,279
All your makeup looks so awkward.

1152
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:07,109
- Don't wear it. - What?

1153
01:23:08,779 --> 01:23:09,989
Just like Yu Jung,

1154
01:23:09,989 --> 01:23:11,869
it's best to take a picture just the way you are.

1155
01:23:12,909 --> 01:23:13,949
Don't you think so?

Gosh.

1160
01:23:25,550 --> 01:23:27,090

and an hour for the makeup today.

1162

Two hours?

1163
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:31,680
Just shut your mouth.

1164
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:34,470
Gosh.

1165
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:36,560
Yu Jung!

1166
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,729

1172
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,489
Go and remove it now!

1173
01:23:48,489 --> 01:23:50,319
Is that our teacher?

1174
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:52,279
Block him!

1175
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:54,989
Get out quickly!

1176
01:23:54,989 --> 01:23:56,239

1178
01:23:58,289 --> 01:24:00,000
Let me in.

Move over, you punks!

1181
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,300
Sit down!

1182
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:07,960
Come on!

1183
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,180
(Duty After School)

1184
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:35,989
- Goodness. - Tell me.

1185
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:38,909
Who ordered you...

1186
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:40,909
to do something tough like this?

1187
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:42,699
Mr. Lee, of course!

1188
01:26:43,409 --> 01:26:45,619
I miss my mom!

1189
01:26:57,550 --> 01:26:59,180
Wait. What is this?

1190
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,470
This is very heavy

1191
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:04,180
It's all lined up

1192
01:27:04,180 --> 01:27:05,850
The soldiers gave us weapons

1193
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:07,939
We haven't seen them except for in games so far

1194
01:27:07,939 --> 01:27:09,060
Can we really use this?

1195
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:10,609
- If we join the army? - Something this heavy?

1196
01:27:10,609 --> 01:27:12,569
In games, we just go back and forth

1197
01:27:12,569 --> 01:27:14,649
Everything is possible by moving your hands a bit

1198
01:27:14,649 --> 01:27:15,689
- Bang! - Bang!

1199
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:23,029
A strange sound I haven't heard

1200
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:24,489
I wake up by that sound

1201
01:27:24,659 --> 01:27:26,619
They wake me up so early, I run like crazy

1202
01:27:26,619 --> 01:27:27,960
I get exhausted after that

1203
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:29,539
When would this end?

1204
01:27:29,539 --> 01:27:31,289
Do I have to eat this?

1205
01:27:31,289 --> 01:27:33,000
I wish the snack bar is open

1206
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,750
I can't stand this food anymore

1207
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:36,130
- Boom - Boom

1208
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,140
They tell us to build up physical strength

1209
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:44,850
- We really don't want to do this - We really don't want to do this

1210
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:46,640
They tell us to run more if we want to survive

1211
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,479
If we run even more, our lungs might burst out

1212
01:27:48,729 --> 01:27:50,149
What can I even protect?

1213
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:52,109
Someone who loses rock-paper-scissors should do it

1214
01:27:52,109 --> 01:27:53,899
Anyway, someone has to do it

1215
01:27:53,899 --> 01:27:55,609
Mr. Commander is ordering us

1216
01:27:55,609 --> 01:27:56,989
Protect even if it's hard for you

1217
01:27:56,989 --> 01:27:58,529
But when would it end?

1218
01:27:58,529 --> 01:28:00,319
It's natural for us to do it for other people, they say

1219
01:28:00,319 --> 01:28:02,069
But why does it have to be us?

1220
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:04,159
Cowardly people in high ranks

1221
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:05,659
All seem to have run away

1222
01:28:05,659 --> 01:28:07,000
- Even adults can't do this - Even adults can't do this

1223
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,539
- Why are they telling us to do it? - Why are they telling us to do it?

1224
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:09,710
- Why? - Why?

1225
01:28:11,289 --> 01:28:12,750
Hey, No Ae Seol!

1226
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:15,039
Gosh, where is she?

1227
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:22,390
Gosh.

1228
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:24,470
If we go to college after this

1229
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:26,180
Let's do everything

1230
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:27,890
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1231
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:29,810
We'll become adults soon

1232
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:31,310
If we go to college after this

1233
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:32,850
Let's do everything

1234
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:34,560
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1235
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,569
We'll become adults soon

1236
01:28:36,569 --> 01:28:38,189
- If we go to college after this - If we go to college after this

1237
01:28:38,189 --> 01:28:39,819
- Let's do everything - Let's do everything

1238
01:28:39,819 --> 01:28:41,529
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1239
01:28:41,529 --> 01:28:43,529
- We'll become adults soon - We'll become adults soon

1240
01:28:43,529 --> 01:28:45,029
- If we go to college after this - If we go to college after this

1241
01:28:45,029 --> 01:28:46,659
- Let's do everything - Let's do everything

1242
01:28:46,659 --> 01:28:48,409
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1243
01:28:48,409 --> 01:28:50,539
- We'll become adults soon - We'll become adults soon

1244
01:28:50,619 --> 01:28:52,420
Sing a military song.

1245
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:53,500
The song is...

1246
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,630
- Born as - Born as

1247
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,210
- a 12th grader - a 12th grader

1248
01:28:57,210 --> 01:29:00,550
- We have darn so much work to do - We have darn so much work to do

1249
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,720
- You and I protecting the country - You and I protecting the country

1250
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:07,350
- Do not say it's an honor - Do not say it's an honor

1251
01:29:12,979 --> 01:29:15,189
Who changed the military song and sang it?

1252
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:20,109
I guess everyone has so much energy.

1253
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:23,949
Gather in the school yard in five minutes.

1254
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:25,489
- What? - Excuse me?

1255
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,949
- Nonsense. - That's impossible.

1256
01:29:27,949 --> 01:29:29,329
Are you crazy?

1257
01:29:29,329 --> 01:29:30,409
It's nonsense.

1258
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:32,329
Gosh.

1259
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:33,920
Only five people who get there first.

1260
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:35,170
- Five? - Five.

1261
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:36,210
Run!

1262
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:38,000
Run!

1263
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,210
- Come with me! - Darn it!

1264
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,930
(School motto)

1265
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:51,180
(Protect even if it's hard for you.)

1266
01:29:56,729 --> 01:29:59,109
(But when would it end?)

1267
01:29:59,109 --> 01:30:01,399
(If we go to college after this)

1268
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:03,529
(Let's do everything)

1269
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:14,329
If we go to college after this

1270
01:30:14,329 --> 01:30:15,920
Let's do everything

1271
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:18,420
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1272
01:30:47,569 --> 01:30:49,489
If we go to college after this

1273
01:30:49,489 --> 01:30:51,619
Let's do everything

1274
01:30:51,619 --> 01:30:54,289
Let's go to a retreat and hang out together

1275
01:30:54,289 --> 01:30:56,789
We'll become adults soon

1276
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,020
You, there...

1277
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:24,149
Shall we disclose it?

1278
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:28,659
Open the door!

1279
01:31:29,069 --> 01:31:31,369
How dare you make fun of the commander?

1280
01:31:34,289 --> 01:31:36,289
You were so cool!

1281
01:31:37,250 --> 01:31:38,289
Encore!

1282
01:31:38,289 --> 01:31:42,840
- Encore! - Encore!

1283
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:46,760
- Encore! - Encore!

1284
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:49,430
- Encore! - Encore!
