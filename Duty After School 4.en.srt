(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:10,646 --> 00:00:12,010
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:46,880
What is this?

4
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:51,642
Something suddenly fell from above.

5
00:00:52,227 --> 00:00:55,625
And then... And then what happened again?

6
00:00:56,776 --> 00:00:57,920
Darn it.

7
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:03,175
Oh, right. Duk Joong. Did he arrive safely?

8
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:05,387
What about Na Ra?

9
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,942
Darn it. Where are the other cars?

10
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:32,663
Don't tell me we're the only ones who escaped.

11
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:33,929
No way.

12
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:36,398
They must be behind us.

13
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:47,873
I wonder if the shelter is all right.

14
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:50,555
The shelter our parents are.

15
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:55,675
Mom.

16
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:59,301
Mom.

17
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:02,232
Mom.

18
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:05,568
Hey. Stop crying, will you?

19
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:07,847
It's annoying.

20
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:18,916
The others must be in another car, right?

21
00:02:20,197 --> 00:02:21,659
Including Won Bin.

22
00:02:24,736 --> 00:02:27,629
Yes. They're probably okay.

23
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,288
They must be okay.

24
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:51,368
Gosh. I must be crazy.

25
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:56,241
I'm dead scared but dead sleepy at the same time.

26
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,317
Well, me too.

27
00:03:01,986 --> 00:03:03,823
Is it because I feel relaxed now?

28
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:10,981
I hope...

29
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:15,240
it all turns out to be a dream after I wake up.

30
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,003
What was that? Darn it!

31
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,077
What the heck?

32
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:34,582
Guys, get out!

33
00:03:34,977 --> 00:03:36,946
Stop! It's dangerous!

34
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:40,235
Stop it! Get out!

35
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:42,793
- Shoot straight!
- Hurry up!

36
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:43,917
Shoot!

37
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:55,851
"Shoot?"

38
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:03,361
Darn it.

39
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:09,348
Oh, gosh. Are you guys all right?

40
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:11,884
It hurts.

41
00:04:12,306 --> 00:04:14,144
Is everyone okay?

42
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:15,993
- Hold on a second.
- So Yeon.

43
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:18,272
- Where's So Yeon?
- What?

44
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:22,345
So Yeon!

45
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:24,930
So Yeon. Are you okay?

46
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:26,954
Chi Yeol, help her up.

47
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:30,769
Get up. Be careful.

48
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:32,756
- Hold her arm.
- Be careful.

49
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:35,418
Let her sit down. Here, sit. Slowly.

50
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:36,935
Are you okay?

51
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:38,359
Let us have a look.

52
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,106
- Darn it.
- Oh, my gosh.

53
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:42,986
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

54
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:57,322
- You scared me!
- What is it?

55
00:04:57,346 --> 00:05:01,332
- It hurts. What do I do?
- Are you okay?

56
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:03,413
I think my bone is broken.

57
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:04,423
Let me see.

58
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:06,463
- It's bad, right?
- Darn it.

59
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:07,464
Hey. Stop being a crybaby.

60
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:09,323
- It hurts.
- It's just a scratch.

61
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:12,889
But it hurts.

62
00:05:14,286 --> 00:05:15,848
Will So Yeon be okay?

63

65
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:41,178
Darn it.

66
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:52,500
It's empty.

67
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:54,716
- What about you?
- Me too.

68
00:06:58,267 --> 00:06:59,367
Darn it.

69
00:07:01,226 --> 00:07:03,888
I'm sorry. Seriously.

70
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:07,332
- I think she has a fever.
- What?

71
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:10,656
What do we do? Hang in there, So Yeon.

72
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,055

(Original Work: "Duty After School" from Naver Webtoon)

74
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:18,018
How are the soldiers?

75
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,432
They're all dead.

76
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:22,601
- What?
- What?

77
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:26,723
Darn it. What now?

78
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:28,824
What do we do now?

79
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,903
Isn't it obvious? We should go back to Seoul.

80
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:34,522
Hey, are you crazy? Can't you see all of this?

81
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:36,863
We're out of bullets. So what? Return so that we can die?

82
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:38,217
What else can we do?

83
00:07:38,677 --> 00:07:41,572
Where were we assembling again? Shouldn't we go there?

84
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:43,576
- Mount Soak.
- Right, Mount Soak.

85
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:46,310
There are soldiers there. It should be safer than Seoul.

86
00:07:46,437 --> 00:07:48,867
Young Sin. How long will it take us to Mount Soak?

87
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:01,418
We're about here. The gathering place is over here.

88
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:03,932
It's about 20km from here to the gathering place.

89
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:06,387
- What? About 20km?
- About 20km?

90
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:08,823
Darn it.

91
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,392
Are you mad?

92
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,233
How on earth can we walk 20km in this blazing heat?

93
00:08:13,257 --> 00:08:16,572
Rather than getting tired midway, let's wait here to get rescued.

94
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,283
He's right, guys. Let's just wait, okay?

95
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:22,863
Hey. What if a sphere jumps out as we wait?

96
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:25,867
What if it does as we walk? Is that any different?

97
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:28,376
And look.

98
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:30,975
There aren't as many spheres here compared to Seoul.

99
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:39,717
There are no traces of fallen spheres either.

100
00:08:40,077 --> 00:08:44,432
What? Why aren't there any here when there are tons in Seoul?

101
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:48,750
Is it because there are no people here?

102
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:52,691
Is that why?

103
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:55,591
I can't go. I'm going to wait here.

104
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:01,865
Hey, guys. It didn't seem like any other cars passed by...

105
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:03,804
on our way here.

106
00:09:04,097 --> 00:09:06,032
Isn't it better to go to Mount Soak?

107
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:07,743
Will you use your darn brains already?

108
00:09:07,767 --> 00:09:09,583
Let's just stay here, you idiots!

109
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:11,243
Seriously! Hey.

110
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,709
Will you take responsibility if no one comes? Will you?

111
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:14,963
You little...

112
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:18,252
Guys, we better move to a place we can rest first.

113
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:19,752
So Yeon's condition looks bad.

114
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:23,843
Darn it. Hey. Look around, will you?

115
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:25,560
Where on earth can we rest?

116
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:28,933
Forget it. I can walk. Let's go to the gathering place.

117
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:30,694
- Hey.
- It hurts.

118
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,483
I stopped the bleeding. But her wound is severe.

119
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,483
She'll get worse if we don't get her treated fast.

120
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:39,193
Then let's search as we walk...

121
00:09:39,217 --> 00:09:41,097
Darn it! Seriously!

122
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,505
Do you only use your brain to study?

123
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:47,676
We don't even know what's around.

124
00:09:48,306 --> 00:09:49,913
Are we going to look around blindly?

125
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:59,333
Yes. Hee Rak's right.

126
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:01,655
There aren't any villages on the map.

127
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:04,787
It's best not to move when we don't know anything.

128
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:08,843
See that? Cho Young Sin is the only one who understands.

129
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,978
Just stay here, you bunch of scum!

130
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:18,442
We saw it today, didn't we?

131
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,550
What happened to our friends.

132
00:10:22,757 --> 00:10:25,463
I don't want any of us to fall into danger.

133
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:28,926
I don't want to lose anyone.

134
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:45,512
Let's search the area first.

135
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:49,155
If we don't find anything after looking around for 30 minutes...

136
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:52,011
Let's think about it, then.

137
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:59,935
Then I'll search that side first.

138
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,772
- I'll take the other side.
- Okay. This side for me.

139
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,073
I'll go with Tae Man.

140
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,702
Hey. Take me with you.

141
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:11,485
You guys. Since when did we have such great teamwork?

142
00:11:23,906 --> 00:11:26,513
You can stay here with Young Sin.

143
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:30,467
Gosh.

144
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,756
Get out.

145
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:27,055
I don't think the first vehicle arrived yet.

146
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:54,097
Are you all okay?

147
00:12:59,247 --> 00:13:00,523
What about the first vehicle?

148
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,065
They were ahead of us.

149
00:13:25,487 --> 00:13:26,674
Did you see that?

150
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:16,026
Why aren't they here yet?

151
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:20,862
I hope nothing happened to them.

152
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:27,187
They should already be here.

153
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,733
Something bad must've happened to them.

154
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:30,857
No way.

155
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:34,329
- They'll be here soon.
- You saw what happened.

156
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:35,863
In Hye was trying to get in the vehicle and...

157
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:36,953
Hey.

158
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,164
Yoo Ha Na.

159
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:53,554
Starting this moment,

160
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:57,717
stay here until further orders.

161
00:14:57,826 --> 00:14:58,971
What about the others?

162
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:01,426
We haven't...

163
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:03,307
heard from them yet.

164
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,126
You haven't heard from them?

165
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:06,772
They should already be here.

166
00:15:06,796 --> 00:15:09,734
Don't worry. They'll be fine.

167
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:10,937
Let's wait a bit longer.

168
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:12,191
Until when?

169
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:13,443
Hey.

170
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,765
You should've let us leave when we wanted to.

171
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:18,342
- Darn it.
- Il Ha.

172
00:15:18,977 --> 00:15:20,803
- What?
- That's enough.

173
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,973
If it weren't for him,

174
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:25,803
we wouldn't be alive now.

175
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:33,506
Lieutenant.

176
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:39,146
Please make sure...

177
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:42,062
the others arrive safely.

178
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,477
Please.

179
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:03,656
You should...

180
00:16:05,436 --> 00:16:06,536
all get some rest.

181
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:15,230
Darn it.

182
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,071
I'm tired and hungry.

183
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,130
I hate all this.

184
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,291
I hate it.

185
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:34,654
There's nothing.

186
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:36,451
We didn't find anything either.

187
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:39,656
Hey, guys!

188
00:16:43,597 --> 00:16:44,697
Did you find something?

189
00:16:45,646 --> 00:16:46,622
Yes.

190
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:47,622
- What?
- What?

191
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:48,746
Where?

192
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:52,036
Over there.

193
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:54,244
Are you serious?

194
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:57,116
- I'll help you get up.
- Okay.

195
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,296
One, two.

196
00:16:59,196 --> 00:17:00,296
Are you okay?

197
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:03,510
I'll carry So Yeon.

198
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:06,154
- Okay.
- No, thanks. I can walk.

199
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,430
Your injury will get worse. Get on his back.

200
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:09,636
I'm fine.

201
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:12,315
I'll walk until I can't.

202
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:14,517
Help her.

203
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:17,233
- I'll help her.
- Hold her for a minute.

204
00:17:17,257 --> 00:17:18,357
Okay.

205
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,297
We're ready. Let's go.

206
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:32,077
Wait a second.

207
00:17:34,066 --> 00:17:35,043
Aren't you going?

208
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:36,255
I want to,

209
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:39,502
but my knee hurts so much I can't take a single step.

210
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,423
Hey. Stop being a baby.

211
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:44,342
It really hurts.

212
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:45,741
She's so annoying.

213
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:47,774
I'll carry Soon Yi then.

214
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:50,201
You're too weak to carry anyone.

215
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:00,607
There.

216
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:02,748
Stop worrying and get on my back.

217
00:18:04,136 --> 00:18:05,236
Thank you.

218
00:18:08,517 --> 00:18:10,254
I'm quite heavy.

219
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:17,350
Let's go.

220
00:18:18,566 --> 00:18:19,666
Are we leaving?

221
00:18:19,737 --> 00:18:21,574
We're leaving?

222
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:24,416
Those crazy idiots.

223
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:25,716
Seriously?

224
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:28,144
- Hey.
- Yes?

225
00:18:28,997 --> 00:18:30,097
You're staying, right?

226
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,476
What?

227
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:37,312
Hey, Park So Yoon. Wait for me!

228
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:38,436
Hurry up.

229
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:43,357
Darn it.

230
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,347
No way.

231
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:09,716
We're at war.

232
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:13,762
Transport vehicles are as important as soldiers' lives during a war.

233
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:16,272
I can't let you use it for personal reasons.

234
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:20,663
It isn't a personal reason.

235
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:24,255
Some of my platoon members seem to have fallen behind.

236
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:28,572
Please help me find them.

237
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:29,696
Lieutenant Lee.

238
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,930
Take a look outside.

239
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:35,032
It isn't just your platoon members.

240
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:38,775
Tons of Student Reserve Forces haven't arrived yet.

241
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:41,630
None of the Jungreung High School students made it here.

242
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:43,923
Don't cause more damage,

243
00:19:43,947 --> 00:19:45,383
and take care of the kids that are here.

244
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:47,243
I'm sure the kids are alive.

245
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:56,386
Please.

246
00:19:59,876 --> 00:20:00,976
I'm begging you.

247
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:04,396
Later,

248
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:07,053
you'll be thanking me.

249
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:25,130
How did it go?

250
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:35,938
What should we do now?

251
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:38,521
Won Bin.

252
00:20:38,997 --> 00:20:40,195
Yes.

253
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,838
How much do you trust me?

254
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,864
I'll even trust you if you say pigs fly.

255
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:54,196
Thank you.

256
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:01,332
I need to ask you for a tough favour.

257
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:02,545
I said I trusted you.

258
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:04,880
Don't ask for a favour.

259
00:21:07,316 --> 00:21:08,604
Just give me orders.

260
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:15,265
Darn it.

261
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:16,849
It's so hot.

262
00:21:21,626 --> 00:21:23,433
I can't take this any longer! Hey, Chi Yeol.

263
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:25,624
When will we arrive at the house? Darn it.

264
00:21:25,677 --> 00:21:26,952
Did you really see one?

265
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:32,665
Careful.

266
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:39,117
I'm sure...

267
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:40,997
it's here somewhere.

268
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:45,685
So where is it, you idiot?

269
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:47,206
Well...

270
00:21:47,566 --> 00:21:49,678
I'm not familiar with this area and was running.

271
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:51,173
It must be here somewhere.

272
00:21:51,197 --> 00:21:52,512
You idiot.

273
00:21:52,536 --> 00:21:54,342
I shouldn't have believed him.

274
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:55,466
Hee Rak.

275
00:21:55,786 --> 00:21:57,802
That's enough. You aren't the only one exhausted.

276
00:21:57,826 --> 00:22:01,393
I told you we should stay there, you idiots.

277
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:03,062
If we stayed there like I said we should,

278
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:04,374
we'd be rescued by now.

279
00:22:04,796 --> 00:22:06,490
This is so annoying!

280
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:19,339
- I see it!
- Where?

281
00:22:19,397 --> 00:22:20,663
Over there.

282
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:21,787
What?

283
00:22:30,737 --> 00:22:32,068
We're saved!

284
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:34,658
- I'm so relieved!
- I know.

285
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:36,348
Gosh.

286
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:37,433
Hey, guys.

287
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,932
There's a room here. Let's have So Yeon lie down inside.

288
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:43,102
- We're here.
- Just a little more.

289
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:44,732
(Safety first)

290
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:48,533
Watch your step.

291
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:56,950
Darn it.

292
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:00,325
Put her down here.

293
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,134
Here you go.

294
00:23:03,187 --> 00:23:04,979
- I'll help her.
- Okay.

295
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:06,820
One second, So Yeon.

296
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:12,104
Thank you.

297
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:14,297
It's okay.

298
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:34,044
What was that?

299
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:38,443
(Under construction)

300
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:40,259
It's so hot.

301
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:43,523
She has a high fever.

302
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,832
Find me some clean water and cloth to cover her wound.

303
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:48,243
- I'll go and find it.
- I'll help.

304
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:53,633
Also, try to find medication for her fever or antiseptics.

305
00:23:53,657 --> 00:23:55,438
Okay, I'll go look.

306
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:03,852
Let's look for food or anything that will come in handy.

307
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:04,976
Okay.

308
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:14,465
Darn it.

309
00:24:19,636 --> 00:24:21,362
Liquid nitrogen.

310
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:27,448
(Liquid nitrogen)

311
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:37,266
Why are they making me do this?

312
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:47,832
(Storage area, Water supply and drainage facility)

313
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:55,975
Darn it.

314
00:24:56,717 --> 00:24:59,236
Everything here is useless.

315
00:25:01,927 --> 00:25:04,688
I wonder if everyone in the other vehicle arrived safely.

316
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:10,131
I can't wait to see them.

317
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:22,798
Soo Chul, you've been quiet.

318
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:25,743
What is it? Do you feel sick?

319
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:31,602
Do you think the others are alive?

320
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:35,070
Of course. Why would you ask that?

321
00:25:44,136 --> 00:25:46,986
- Woo Taek.
- What?

322
00:25:49,106 --> 00:25:51,076
I couldn't save Woo Taek.

323
00:25:52,647 --> 00:25:55,441
What do you mean? Isn't he in the second vehicle?

324
00:25:56,447 --> 00:25:57,678
Woo Taek...

325
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:06,597
I left him behind.

326
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:17,116
No way.

327
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:20,924
Is Woo Taek dead?

328
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:37,714
There's nothing here.

329
00:26:39,657 --> 00:26:43,088
How is there nothing here?

330
00:26:43,366 --> 00:26:45,247
Did anyone even live here?

331
00:26:45,407 --> 00:26:47,376
(Butane gas)

332
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:50,474
- Did you find anything?
- What?

333
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:54,319
No, I didn't.

334
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:56,940
What is with you?

335
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:04,067
I found something. Look.

336
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:12,913
I'm sorry. That must hurt. Hang in there.

337
00:27:12,937 --> 00:27:14,037
Here you go.

338
00:27:21,856 --> 00:27:23,100
I'm cold.

339
00:27:26,987 --> 00:27:28,593
Her fever won't drop.

340
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,927
We need a fever reducer.

341
00:27:31,286 --> 00:27:32,980
This looks like cold medicine.

342
00:27:33,707 --> 00:27:35,632
(Fever reducer)

343
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:41,525
So Yeon, this is a fever reducer. Take it.

344
00:27:43,336 --> 00:27:44,667
Here's some water.

345
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:53,190
I think this was a construction site office.

346
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:55,915
There is nothing to eat here other than water.

347
00:27:56,187 --> 00:27:57,979
I found a blanket.

348
00:27:58,106 --> 00:28:00,812
I think we can create a stretcher for So Yeon with it.

349
00:28:00,856 --> 00:28:04,156
I found something quite important. Something we need at night.

350
00:28:05,987 --> 00:28:07,087
What is it?

351
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,474
Mosquito repellent incense.

352
00:28:11,497 --> 00:28:12,784
Seriously.

353
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:16,878
Do you know how vicious mountain mosquitoes are?

354
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:20,280
I'm hungry.

355
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:26,578
The phone is dead. Darn it.

356
00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:28,461
We'll starve to death at this rate.

357
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:36,577
- Where are you going?
- What?

358
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:44,581
The bathroom.

359
00:28:59,376 --> 00:29:02,215
No one will get full if I share.

360
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:06,400
It's better for one person to get full.

361
00:29:24,606 --> 00:29:28,002
Who is going to take responsibility if something goes wrong?

362
00:29:28,026 --> 00:29:29,270
I'm sorry, sir.

363
00:29:29,737 --> 00:29:31,112
This isn't the first time.

364
00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:35,512
Reorganize this starting from a month ago.

365
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:36,636
Yes, sir.

366
00:29:37,786 --> 00:29:38,930
Sir.

367
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,516
(Park Jin Soo)

368
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,853
Park Jin Soo, I didn't expect to see you here.

369
00:29:54,477 --> 00:29:56,105
(Kim Won Bin, Republic of Korea Army)

370
00:29:57,647 --> 00:29:59,532
- Do I know you?
- Come on.

371
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:01,394
We were in the same troop.

372
00:30:02,776 --> 00:30:04,284
From where?

373
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:07,463
Nonsan.

374
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:09,082
- Nonsan?
- Yes.

375
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,393
I was in Chuncheon.

376
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:18,677
We said it would've been easy if we were stationed in Nonsan.

377
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:21,143
I'm disappointed you don't remember me.

378
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:23,597
Come on. Can't you remember me?

379
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:31,482
That's right. You wanted chocolate snacks so bad...

380
00:30:31,717 --> 00:30:35,347
that you converted to Catholicism. Don't you remember?

381
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:43,123
I remember.

382
00:30:43,147 --> 00:30:46,502
There you go. You startled me.

383
00:30:46,526 --> 00:30:48,792
- How have you been?
- Good.

384
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:49,960
It's so good to see you.

385
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:53,576
Have a seat. It's really good to see you.

386
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:58,842
Did all your kids make it here?

387
00:30:58,866 --> 00:31:01,012
Yes, they did.

388
00:31:01,036 --> 00:31:03,352
Why? Aren't your kids here yet?

389
00:31:03,376 --> 00:31:06,907
No, I'm waiting.

390
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:10,062
They'll be here soon. Just wait and see.

391
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:11,736
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

392
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:17,421
Sergeant Park Jin Soo at Transportation speaking.

393
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,873
Yes, sir.

394
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:22,458
I'm getting it ready, sir.

395
00:31:23,397 --> 00:31:24,497
Yes.

396
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:27,979
I'll have it ready by 1pm.

397
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:30,247
Yes.

398
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:33,125
Yes, sir.

399
00:31:34,116 --> 00:31:38,052
You're still muscular.

400
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:39,973
Of course, I still work out.

401
00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:40,974
- You do?
- Yes.

402
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:42,012
Keep up the good work.

403
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:43,180
- Okay.
- See you.

404
00:31:43,826 --> 00:31:45,070
Wait a minute.

405
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:50,444
What is it?

406
00:31:57,507 --> 00:31:58,794
Do you have any cigarettes?

407
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,862
I don't smoke.

408
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:03,461
- Stop lying.
- I'm serious.

409
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:08,373
Wait a second. Give me your hand.

410
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:09,920
What?

411
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:18,963
You really don't smoke.

412
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:21,473
No, that's what I told you.

413
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:23,512
- I'll smoke next time. See you.
- Okay.

414
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:26,011
Bye, Won Bin.

415
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:36,483
Do you know what the punishment is...

416
00:32:36,507 --> 00:32:38,531
for stealing a transport vehicle during a war?

417
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:40,446
Death.

418
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:44,644
I know that much.

419
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:48,121
I'll be back.

420
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:51,367
I'll go with you.

421
00:32:55,276 --> 00:32:57,173
No, if I'm sentenced to death,

422
00:32:57,197 --> 00:32:59,308
I need someone to take care of my dog tags.

423
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:12,155
Gosh.

424
00:33:13,757 --> 00:33:15,602
- Won Bin.
- You scared me.

425
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,376
What are you doing here?

426
00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:20,009
Where is the lieutenant going?

427
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:22,578
He isn't going to eat something.

428
00:33:24,227 --> 00:33:26,239
It's none of your business.

429
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,895
You should button up.

430
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:34,019
Wait.

431
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:39,216
Let's go.

432
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:43,079
Be honest. What were you eating in there?

433
00:33:44,036 --> 00:33:45,269
Ginkgo nuts?

434
00:33:49,412 --> 00:33:51,023
Listen, guys.

435
00:33:51,047 --> 00:33:52,245
Guys.

436
00:33:53,007 --> 00:33:55,812
I think the platoon commander is off to rescue the kids.

437
00:33:57,846 --> 00:33:59,221
- Really?
- Yes.

438
00:34:00,017 --> 00:34:02,953
We've been told to wait here until further notice.

439
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:04,582
So why else would he go outside?

440
00:34:05,027 --> 00:34:07,502
He must have the same thing in mind.

441
00:34:08,197 --> 00:34:10,293
I also think Soo Chul and the others are alive.

442
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:11,713
Would they be dead, then?

443
00:34:11,737 --> 00:34:14,035
- Of course, they're alive.
- Right.

444
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:15,646
Speaking of which,

445
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:18,262
I'm going to go with him.

446
00:34:18,286 --> 00:34:19,617
Hey, are you out of...

447
00:34:19,996 --> 00:34:22,614
Are you out of your mind? Aren't you scared?

448
00:34:22,706 --> 00:34:24,268
Yes, I'm scared.

449
00:34:24,797 --> 00:34:27,312
But if it were Soo Chul, he'd come for my rescue...

450
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:28,624
without thinking twice.

451
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:33,277
I'll go with you.

452
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:36,475
I'm too frustrated to wait without doing anything.

453
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:44,711
Hey, Na Ra.

454
00:34:47,737 --> 00:34:49,793
- Get me my gun too.
- Hey!

455
00:34:55,197 --> 00:34:56,341
Darn it.

456
00:34:59,536 --> 00:35:00,681
Ae Seol.

457
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:04,102
What are you doing? You can't even protect yourself.

458
00:35:04,126 --> 00:35:05,776
Just stay here.

459
00:35:06,376 --> 00:35:07,664
I'm going too.

460
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:10,301
Look, guys.

461
00:35:10,336 --> 00:35:13,113
Let's try to think rationally.

462
00:35:13,137 --> 00:35:15,513
If they're alive, they would've come already.

463
00:35:15,757 --> 00:35:17,992
And what if we get caught going outside to rescue them?

464
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:19,249
If we get caught,

465
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:21,737
then what?

466
00:35:24,146 --> 00:35:25,742
We could get penalty points all together...

467
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:27,372
to take joint responsibility or whatnot.

468
00:35:27,396 --> 00:35:28,771
- Then...
- You idiot.

469
00:35:29,606 --> 00:35:31,213
You actually think we'll take the CSAT in this situation?

470
00:35:31,237 --> 00:35:33,206
They didn't say we wouldn't.

471
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:34,644
So we'll probably take it.

472
00:35:35,907 --> 00:35:38,843
You know we can't go to the college we want if we get penalty points.

473
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:39,967
Gosh.

474
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:45,181
Forget it.

475
00:35:45,626 --> 00:35:47,364
What did I even expect from you?

476
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:48,604
I'm off.

477
00:35:51,376 --> 00:35:52,476
Me too.

478
00:35:57,047 --> 00:35:59,390
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm not going.

479
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:02,789
Gosh! What?

480
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:06,501
Goodness...

481
00:36:23,206 --> 00:36:26,000
Gosh. Kimchi, hand me the pincers.

482
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:30,222
- Hey.
- What?

483
00:36:30,246 --> 00:36:31,633
What's on your mind?

484
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:35,903
No, nothing.

485
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,115
What is it?

486
00:36:40,757 --> 00:36:44,412
Anyway, it seems those people rushed away from this place.

487
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:47,073
They even left a delivery van in the garage.

488
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:48,282
Darn it.

489
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:50,693
Why couldn't you tell us sooner?

490
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:52,872
Let's ride that to escape.

491
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:54,963
Will you cut the nonsense?

492
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:56,753
- None of us can drive.
- I'll do it.

493
00:36:56,777 --> 00:36:58,423
You're poor at driving a motorcycle, to begin with.

494
00:36:58,447 --> 00:37:00,753
Still, I'm better than Kwon Il Ha.

495
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:02,383
What are you saying, idiot?

496
00:37:14,206 --> 00:37:16,374
I should have some left in case I need it later.

497
00:37:33,277 --> 00:37:34,696
Who's screaming?

498
00:37:36,197 --> 00:37:38,485
What is it with her this time?

499
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:44,133
- Darn, we're doomed!
- What on earth?

500
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:45,383
- Woo Taek!
- Let's go inside.

501
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:47,013
- Behind you!
- Gosh.

502
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:48,983
Help me!

503
00:37:49,077 --> 00:37:50,262
Go in!

504
00:37:50,286 --> 00:37:51,263
- What is it?
- Go inside.

505
00:37:51,287 --> 00:37:52,812
- Run!
- Help me!

506
00:37:52,836 --> 00:37:53,972
Behind you, darn it!

507
00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:55,483
- Oh, my.
- Go inside.

508
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:57,244
- Watch out!
- No!

509
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,190
- Run!
- Go inside already.

510
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:05,081
Watch out!

511
00:38:05,347 --> 00:38:06,997
- Goodness!
- Get up!

512
00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:09,085
Close the door!

513
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:21,293
No. That won't be enough.

514
00:38:21,317 --> 00:38:22,516
Let's move this thing.

515
00:38:22,737 --> 00:38:23,883
Gosh.

516
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:25,713
- Do it with them!
- What's wrong with you?

517
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,672
- Goodness, gracious.
- Hurry up.

518
00:38:42,507 --> 00:38:43,706
Did it leave?

519
00:38:49,516 --> 00:38:50,891
Goodness.

520
00:38:57,027 --> 00:38:59,039
- Darn it.
- Come on!

521
00:39:09,496 --> 00:39:11,512
It's coming through the ventilator!

522
00:39:11,536 --> 00:39:13,186
Go into the room now!

523
00:39:13,246 --> 00:39:14,435
Quickly!

524
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,642
Go!

525
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:17,460
- Get in there!
- Get the door.

526
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:37,053
Do something.

527
00:39:38,027 --> 00:39:39,489
What do we do?

528
00:39:40,527 --> 00:39:42,264
It's okay. Don't worry.

529
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,484
- Soo Chul, the windows.
- Okay.

530
00:39:49,077 --> 00:39:51,046
- Yeon Ju, check that window.
- Okay.

531
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:55,938
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

532
00:39:56,336 --> 00:39:57,656
It doesn't open?

533
00:39:59,706 --> 00:40:01,312
I think this one's good too.

534
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:05,233
Guys, over here!

535
00:40:05,257 --> 00:40:06,577
- Let's block this.
- Darn it.

536
00:40:27,277 --> 00:40:29,620
Why does it keep moving around?

537
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:39,358
Did it leave?

538
00:40:53,556 --> 00:40:55,624
Darn it. There are two.

539
00:40:57,686 --> 00:40:59,061
Let's check.

540
00:40:59,726 --> 00:41:01,519
No, don't.

541
00:41:03,436 --> 00:41:05,273
I think we should check.

542
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,039
I think there's just one.

543
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:11,573
What are you guys doing here?

544
00:42:13,387 --> 00:42:14,904
You're off to find the kids.

545
00:42:14,927 --> 00:42:18,325
Leave it to me and go back to the camp.

546
00:42:23,016 --> 00:42:24,172
Do you know...

547
00:42:25,146 --> 00:42:27,115
what will happen if you get caught?

548
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:29,616
Probably get penalty points.

549
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:32,545
What about you, though?

550
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:35,883
- Duk Joong.
- What?

551
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:37,424
What happens in this case?

552
00:42:38,036 --> 00:42:40,325
He'll be executed, at the least.

553
00:42:44,286 --> 00:42:45,673
Let's keep going.

554
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:48,087
We've come too far to go back.

555
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:50,959
Let's just go back.

556
00:43:14,317 --> 00:43:15,648
What is this?

557
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:18,702
The thing is...

558
00:43:19,746 --> 00:43:22,683
Jun Hee, did you have ramyeon?

559
00:43:25,286 --> 00:43:26,386
Well...

560
00:43:29,706 --> 00:43:32,193
But I couldn't eat anything all day.

561
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:34,023
Are you out of your mind? We're all starving!

562
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:36,363
You let that thing find you...

563
00:43:36,387 --> 00:43:37,673
while eating alone in secret?

564
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:40,515
- Let go.
- Knock it off.

565
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:42,558
What matters is how we will escape.

566
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,013
I'm sorry.

567
00:43:55,407 --> 00:43:58,262
Anyway, why did it suddenly stop...

568
00:43:58,286 --> 00:43:59,750
moving around?

569
00:44:00,617 --> 00:44:01,859
Could it be...

570
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:03,969
This is just my guess,

571
00:44:04,536 --> 00:44:07,642
but maybe it knows that we can't run away due to the window guards.

572
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:08,953
What?

573
00:44:09,376 --> 00:44:10,564
Think about it.

574
00:44:10,586 --> 00:44:12,562
It knows that we can't run away through the windows.

575
00:44:12,586 --> 00:44:14,742
It's waiting for us in front of the only way out.

576
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:18,081
It can't be that smart, though.

577
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:20,881
I thought they were unicellular creatures.

578
00:44:21,266 --> 00:44:23,280
We know nothing about the spheres.

579
00:44:23,887 --> 00:44:27,054
If they're intelligent, where they came from,

580
00:44:29,646 --> 00:44:30,890
and why they came.

581
00:44:33,067 --> 00:44:34,585
But one thing is certain.

582
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:37,177
It reacts to sounds.

583
00:44:57,177 --> 00:44:58,365
So Yeon?

584
00:44:59,387 --> 00:45:00,619
So Yeon.

585
00:45:14,317 --> 00:45:15,460
What's going on?

586
00:45:20,197 --> 00:45:23,728
Her wound started festering. Her fever is back too.

587
00:45:24,827 --> 00:45:28,313
She'll be seriously ill if we don't take action.

588
00:45:29,286 --> 00:45:33,048
Let's just get in the truck and drive away.

589
00:45:34,757 --> 00:45:37,044
What am I saying?

590
00:45:39,757 --> 00:45:40,956
What are you doing?

591
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:42,644
I have to tell them.

592
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:45,175
That we should drive away in the truck, as you said.

593
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:49,622
I was just saying. I wasn't actually suggesting it.

594
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:52,759
So, we just sit here and watch So Yeon suffer?

595
00:46:13,376 --> 00:46:14,564
Chi Yeol.

596
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:17,203
Be careful.

597
00:46:17,626 --> 00:46:18,870
I will.

598
00:46:20,137 --> 00:46:23,525
Hee Rak, block it as soon as I leave.

599
00:46:25,217 --> 00:46:26,415
Chi Yeol.

600
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:30,368
Are you sure about this?

601
00:46:32,686 --> 00:46:33,830
I'll be fine.

602
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:42,219
(Disinfectant Storage)

603
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:56,537
(Disinfectant Storage)

604
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:22,337
Shoot.

605
00:47:35,536 --> 00:47:38,341
Hey. Jang Soo.

606
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:40,770
Jang Soo!

607
00:47:54,146 --> 00:47:55,565
How did you get out?

608
00:47:56,516 --> 00:47:57,803
Is that Chi Yeol?

609
00:47:57,896 --> 00:47:59,777
Yes. How did he get here?

610
00:48:00,356 --> 00:48:02,788
So Yeon's condition is worsening.

611
00:48:05,527 --> 00:48:06,814
So, we had an idea.

612
00:48:08,027 --> 00:48:10,557
Why don't we just get in the truck and drive away?

613
00:48:12,746 --> 00:48:15,958
Chi Yeol, do you think you can let us out?

614
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:17,814
Let's see.

615
00:48:27,427 --> 00:48:28,714
Gosh.

616
00:48:30,177 --> 00:48:33,708
No. Not with my bare hands.

617
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:38,424
- We're going to need some tools.
- Tools?

618
00:48:41,146 --> 00:48:44,502
(Butane gas)

619
00:48:44,947 --> 00:48:47,466
Okay. I'll go and find one.

620
00:48:47,697 --> 00:48:48,841
Hey.

621
00:48:50,786 --> 00:48:51,975
Be careful.

622
00:48:52,786 --> 00:48:55,900
I will. Don't worry.

623
00:49:00,626 --> 00:49:02,420
Gosh.

624
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:07,386
Is this the right way?

625
00:49:08,336 --> 00:49:09,811
We'll have to try something.

626
00:49:10,007 --> 00:49:12,217
We can't just stay locked up here.

627
00:49:34,867 --> 00:49:37,067
Come on, man.

628
00:50:00,806 --> 00:50:02,468
- What's taking him so long?
- Gosh.

629
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:05,654
What if something happened to him?

630
00:50:31,797 --> 00:50:32,897
Oh, no.

631
00:51:07,336 --> 00:51:10,043
What was that? What's happening?

632
00:51:16,847 --> 00:51:17,991
Take this!

633
00:51:26,856 --> 00:51:29,881
Guys! Retreat!

634
00:51:30,527 --> 00:51:33,463
Guys! Retreat!

635
00:51:33,487 --> 00:51:34,883
- Open the door!
- The door!

636
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:36,753
Get the door! Hurry!

637
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:38,712
- Let's go.
- Come on!

638
00:51:40,286 --> 00:51:42,803
- Go!
- Where is he?

639
00:51:42,827 --> 00:51:44,262
- Go!
- Run!

640
00:51:44,286 --> 00:51:46,211
Open the door!

641
00:51:47,456 --> 00:51:48,600
The door!

642
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:52,562
- Shoot.
- Chi Yeol!

643
00:51:52,586 --> 00:51:55,443
- What's happening?
- What do you think is happening?

644
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:59,229
- The door!
- Keep running!

645
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:03,391
- This way.
- Hey, Chi Yeol!

646
00:52:04,097 --> 00:52:07,176
- Block it.
- Come back in.

647
00:52:13,487 --> 00:52:14,963
What is going on outside?

648
00:52:14,987 --> 00:52:16,868
You listened to the whole thing, darn it!

649
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,050
At least, Chi Yeol is safe, right?

650
00:52:24,206 --> 00:52:25,493
Guys.

651
00:52:26,916 --> 00:52:28,412
Do you think this can get you out?

652
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:35,959
Kimchi. You were much faster than usual.

653
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:45,150
Let's get ready to break out.

654
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:46,664
Wait.

655
00:52:47,056 --> 00:52:51,193
We have to make the sphere think that we're still inside.

656
00:52:51,777 --> 00:52:53,622
- What?
- How do we do that?

657
00:52:53,646 --> 00:52:55,396
What are you talking about?

658
00:53:00,157 --> 00:53:02,730
- What is he up to?
- I have no idea.

659
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:07,903
("The Host")

660
00:53:19,177 --> 00:53:20,694
What is this?

661
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:26,456
I thought that was only a movie.

662
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:32,393
Do you remember how that movie ends?

663
00:53:32,726 --> 00:53:36,401
They kill the monster and win at the end, right?

664
00:53:39,367 --> 00:53:41,798
Beats me. I haven't watched it.

665
00:53:42,487 --> 00:53:46,711
Yes. That is how it ends.

666
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:49,039
But the daughter they tried to save...

667
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:53,543
ends up dying.

668
00:53:54,206 --> 00:53:57,056
What? She dies?

669
00:54:04,427 --> 00:54:05,944
She dies?

670
00:54:28,077 --> 00:54:30,277
Guys, move this.

671
00:54:31,246 --> 00:54:32,720
It's the guys.

672
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:40,746
Come outside.

673
00:54:52,766 --> 00:54:54,082
- I'm scared.
- Jun Hee.

674
00:54:54,106 --> 00:54:56,031
- Let's go and find the car keys.
- What?

675
00:54:58,777 --> 00:54:59,964
Hey.

676
00:55:03,777 --> 00:55:05,482
(Under construction)

677
00:55:13,036 --> 00:55:14,191
Darn it.

678
00:55:24,757 --> 00:55:26,044
Gosh.

679
00:55:28,217 --> 00:55:29,327
Let me help.

680
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:31,557
Careful.

681
00:55:37,476 --> 00:55:39,732
Oh, gosh.

682
00:56:01,757 --> 00:56:03,319
Darn it.

683
00:56:32,786 --> 00:56:34,222
The flue!

684
00:56:34,246 --> 00:56:35,972
What is it? Gosh.

685
00:56:35,996 --> 00:56:37,690
- Run!
- It's dangerous!

686
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:45,693
Go!

687
00:56:45,717 --> 00:56:47,004
Take her and go first.

688
00:56:47,086 --> 00:56:48,836
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

689
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:51,242
- Let's go!
- Go!

690
00:56:51,266 --> 00:56:52,455
I said go!

691
00:56:53,266 --> 00:56:54,553
Run!

692
00:56:55,226 --> 00:56:57,195
Let me do it. Let's do it together.

693
00:56:57,306 --> 00:56:59,242
- Just leave it and go!
- Go!

694
00:56:59,266 --> 00:57:01,928
- Let's do it together!
- Go!

695
00:57:04,277 --> 00:57:05,293
Run!

696
00:57:05,317 --> 00:57:07,082
- What's going on?
- Run!

697
00:57:07,106 --> 00:57:10,550
- Run!
- Retreat!

698
00:57:13,246 --> 00:57:14,383
I brought So Yeon.

699
00:57:14,407 --> 00:57:15,969
Be careful.

700
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:18,722
Go!

701
00:57:18,746 --> 00:57:20,165
Let's just go!

702
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:23,893
Gosh.

703
00:57:23,917 --> 00:57:25,562
Darn it. Come here!

704
00:57:25,586 --> 00:57:27,005
Hey! It's here!

705
00:57:27,836 --> 00:57:30,730
- There.
- Come here!

706
00:57:31,677 --> 00:57:33,833
Soon Yi! Behind you!

707
00:57:36,137 --> 00:57:37,423
Run, Chi Yeol!

708
00:57:37,896 --> 00:57:39,582
- Let's go. Hurry.
- Chi Yeol.

709
00:57:39,606 --> 00:57:40,912
- Yes?
- Where are Tae Man and Soo Chul?

710
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:42,872
I don't know. The sphere came out.

711
00:57:42,896 --> 00:57:44,821
Come here!

712
00:57:57,327 --> 00:57:58,569
Darn it.

713
00:57:59,327 --> 00:58:01,537
So Yeon, stay with me. All right?

714
00:58:03,626 --> 00:58:04,870
Why aren't they coming?

715
00:58:07,836 --> 00:58:10,136
Hey, do something!

716
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,119
Darn it!

717
00:58:19,266 --> 00:58:20,597
Get up! What are you doing?

718
00:58:23,516 --> 00:58:24,803
Why aren't they coming?

719
00:58:25,067 --> 00:58:27,423
- They are coming.
- Hurry!

720
00:58:27,447 --> 00:58:28,963
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

721
00:58:28,987 --> 00:58:31,213
- Go inside.
- Hurry.

722
00:58:31,237 --> 00:58:33,437
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

723
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:44,141
- It's this, isn't it?
- All right!

724
00:58:44,626 --> 00:58:47,733
- We're going to spend all night!
- Is that not it?

725
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:49,032
Darn it.

726
00:58:58,016 --> 00:58:59,912
Hey. This. This is it, isn't it?

727
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,488
All right!

728
00:59:01,556 --> 00:59:03,118
- All right!
- Hurry!

729
00:59:08,317 --> 00:59:10,883
Darn it. I'm doomed.

730
00:59:10,907 --> 00:59:12,876
- What is it?
- It's manual.

731
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:14,854
What's that?

732
00:59:15,117 --> 00:59:16,883
- How's So Yeon?
- Not good.

733
00:59:16,907 --> 00:59:18,380
Hurry.

734
00:59:18,867 --> 00:59:20,153
There.

735
00:59:23,876 --> 00:59:25,207
Darn it.

736
00:59:28,257 --> 00:59:29,951
What is he doing?

737
00:59:31,217 --> 00:59:32,733
Hey! We have to go!

738
00:59:32,757 --> 00:59:34,363
You said you could drive!

739
00:59:34,387 --> 00:59:35,718
Darn it.

740
00:59:36,717 --> 00:59:38,992
- It's different from my dad's car.
- What?

741
00:59:39,016 --> 00:59:41,363
Darn it. This is crazy. What are we supposed to do then?

742
00:59:41,387 --> 00:59:43,960
- Darn it.
- Gosh.

743
00:59:44,766 --> 00:59:46,702
- Move. I will do it.
- You know how to drive?

744
00:59:46,726 --> 00:59:48,582
- I do. Give it to me.
- You really know?

745
00:59:48,606 --> 00:59:51,456
- Move! Gosh.
- Hey!

746
00:59:51,856 --> 00:59:53,082
- Hey!
- Hey!

747
00:59:53,106 --> 00:59:54,083
- Darn it.
- Hey!

748
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:55,262
Hey!

749
00:59:57,117 --> 00:59:58,998
- Darn it.
- Move. I got it.

750
00:59:59,036 --> 01:00:00,181
Move.

751
01:00:02,117 --> 01:00:03,315
Darn it.

752
01:00:09,456 --> 01:00:11,018
Just a little more.

753
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:14,422
One more time.

754
01:00:17,007 --> 01:00:18,613
- No?
- No.

755
01:00:18,637 --> 01:00:19,992
Darn it. Let's just run.

756
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:22,492
We can't. We will all get caught if we carry her on the back.

757
01:00:22,516 --> 01:00:24,452
So why would you meddle with it when you don't know a thing?

758
01:00:24,476 --> 01:00:26,452
You stop messing around, idiot!

759
01:00:26,476 --> 01:00:28,313
My family runs a driving school!

760
01:00:30,436 --> 01:00:32,780
Darn it.

761
01:00:34,407 --> 01:00:35,914
Isn't that the sphere?

762
01:00:41,996 --> 01:00:43,735
If it comes in here, we will all die.

763
01:00:43,867 --> 01:00:46,484
Our best chance of survival is...

764
01:00:50,666 --> 01:00:52,023
leaving So Yeon behind.

765
01:00:52,047 --> 01:00:53,233
- What?
- What?

766
01:00:53,257 --> 01:00:54,483
Hey. Are you mad?

767
01:00:54,507 --> 01:00:57,576
Right. None of us wants to do that.

768
01:01:04,806 --> 01:01:06,280
It's my fault.

769
01:01:09,186 --> 01:01:10,748
I am sorry, guys.

770
01:01:13,527 --> 01:01:16,420
No, it's not your fault. It's all right.

771
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:19,713
Then one person should lure the sphere and the rest should...

772
01:01:19,737 --> 01:01:22,303
ride the truck and escape. That's the only way.

773
01:01:22,327 --> 01:01:23,834
What if that person gets caught?

774
01:01:23,996 --> 01:01:25,229
That's too risky.

775
01:01:26,367 --> 01:01:28,523
The tentacles!

776
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:32,310
This is...

777
01:01:34,007 --> 01:01:36,888
the best decision we can make to not have any regrets later.

778
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,097
Gosh, will you hurry and choose?

779
01:02:15,206 --> 01:02:16,537

Yes.

It's too short.

799

You don't have anything else to say?

800
01:04:08,117 --> 01:04:10,972
Thanks to you, Dad, I'm getting trained well.

801
01:04:10,996 --> 01:04:14,296
Right. Your dad is a soldier.

802
01:04:14,626 --> 01:04:18,608
Did he not tell you anything when you were coming to the training?

803
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:25,266
There's something he says when he drinks.

804
01:04:25,887 --> 01:04:29,098
You wear a gas mask during the CBR training, you know.

805
01:04:29,137 --> 01:04:31,532
To find out if the training is over,

806
01:04:31,556 --> 01:04:33,823
they have to get one person to take the mask off.

807
01:04:33,847 --> 01:04:35,001
What?

808
01:04:35,056 --> 01:04:36,937
Gosh. Really?

809
01:04:38,016 --> 01:04:39,259
That must be hard to choose.

810
01:04:40,146 --> 01:04:44,327
But if you are the commander, you must not hesitate to do it.

811
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,383
When you decide who can and who can't do it.

812
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:48,173
Whichever decision you make,

813
01:04:48,197 --> 01:04:50,628
the commander becomes the villain at that moment.

814
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:52,019
When I heard that,

815
01:04:52,577 --> 01:04:55,282
I thought I would never be able to be the commander.

816
01:04:56,077 --> 01:04:59,112
The tenacious Cho Young Sin might be able to do it.

817
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:01,484
Then...

818
01:05:02,297 --> 01:05:06,015
what do you think it would be like if you become the commander?

819
01:05:07,507 --> 01:05:08,794
I don't know.

820
01:05:10,677 --> 01:05:13,202
I guess I will have no choice but to become the villain too.
