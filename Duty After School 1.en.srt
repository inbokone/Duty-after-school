A year ago, except for polar regions and some areas in Russia,

83

00:05:17,305 --> 00:05:18,820
Rumours flooded our minds,

89
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:21,620
and roads across the world were a mess.

90
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:23,791
We couldn't sit idly by though.

91
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:26,000

94
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:34,171
If we keep on attacking them,

95
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:37,221
they might take up all the space and we'll be doomed by...

96
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:40,971
I mean, it could lead to a dangerous situation...

97

100
00:05:47,545 --> 00:05:51,231
Detailed X-ray images taken by satellites...

101
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:54,781
and samples collected by dozens of drones...

102
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:56,960
were thoroughly analysed,

103
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:59,450

104
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:02,136
that the spheres were a danger to mankind.

so we were to live our lives normally.

Why couldn't they simply put it like that?

109
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:13,341
The only major change in our lives...

110
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:15,421
was that we travelled by ship now rather than plane.

111
00:06:15,445 --> 00:06:18,421
Travelling via hot air balloons became a new trend,

112
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,221
but we learned to live with the spheres...

113

look like eyes that are hunting their prey?

Or maybe thinking that...

118

- Was that the best you could do?

171

172

173

175

Darn it. Did it have to drop on our area of operations...

176
00:11:17,204 --> 00:11:21,012
where there are plenty of other places to drop?

177

This is the first sphere around the world that dropped.

178

I'm sorry, sir.

180

Shouldn't we cover it with a camouflage tent...

Seriously?

182
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:36,531
Are you going to replace it if it ruins the tent?

183
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:37,709
No, sir.

184
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:40,041

- The impact...

201

ruined the bean field that it landed on.

202

00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:30,590
- Let's go.
- What?

336
00:19:30,614 --> 00:19:32,222
You punks! Stop right there!

337
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,551
You're dead meat once I catch you!

338
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:36,051
- Unbelievable.
- You brats!

339
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,431
Catch them!

340
00:19:37,455 --> 00:19:39,060
- Oh, no.
- Goodness.

341
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:40,060
- Hold on.
- Oh, no.

342
00:19:40,084 --> 00:19:41,100
Is that a wig?

343
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:42,271
It's a wig!

344
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:43,810
- Oh, no.
- He has no hair!

345
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:46,817
- That's a wig!
- Hey. Look at him.

346
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:48,271
- Gosh.
- Oh, dear.

347
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:50,360
- Seriously.
- Hey, you're really hurting me.

348
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:52,034
Hey.

349
00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:53,493
Does it still smell inside?

350
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,211
The smell is gone.

351
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,335
- Gosh.
- It's gone?

352
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:05,711
- Okay.
- Stop it now.

353
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:07,670
- Did you see that?
- That hurts.

354
00:20:07,694 --> 00:20:09,090
- That jerk, Wang Tae Man.
- Gosh.

355
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:11,461
- Come on!
- Hey! You!

356
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:14,102
- You jerk. I'm going to kill you.
- Seriously.

357
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:46,211
- Gosh.
- By the way,

358
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:47,211
does your battery run out this fast?

359
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:49,710
How should I know? I didn't use it a lot, though.

360
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:52,051
They're here again.

361
00:20:52,075 --> 00:20:53,551
Did you see how I got rid of the dean?

362
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:55,775
- His wig came off.
- Hey, they might have it.

363
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,265
- Hi.
- Hi.

364
00:20:57,535 --> 00:20:59,416
Why do you always come to our turf?

365
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:03,184
What are you doing?

366
00:21:03,834 --> 00:21:06,900
Il Ha. You see,

367
00:21:06,924 --> 00:21:10,270
I haven't gotten my nicotine fix. So I'm really sensitive right now.

368
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:11,484
Stay still.

369
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:14,820
Bo Ra. I'm the toughest guy in our class.

370
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:16,741
- Sure. So where is it?
- Hey.

371
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:18,820
- Come on. Where is it?
- Why are you touching me?

372
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:20,452
Wait.

373
00:21:20,604 --> 00:21:21,704
Hold on.

374
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:26,265
Right. I smoked all of them yesterday.

375
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:27,910
Come on.

376
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:29,085
Sorry.

377
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:32,251
Him. Bo Ra.

378
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:34,825
Hey, don't touch me.

379
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:37,070
Okay. I'll look for it.

380
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:47,826
Two cigarettes still remain with me.

381
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:51,278
I thank you for your generosity.

382
00:21:52,384 --> 00:21:54,674
All right. Thank you.

383
00:21:56,975 --> 00:21:58,075
Come on.

384
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:01,625
- Jerks.
- Do you want to die?

385
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,291
Gosh. What's taking her so long?

386
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:06,327
You know that she's slow.

387
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:09,251
Seriously. The bell is going to ring soon.

388
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:11,012
Hey, Bo Ra.

389
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:14,173
Bo Ra. Here's the portable battery.

390
00:22:22,035 --> 00:22:23,135
Hey.

391
00:22:23,164 --> 00:22:24,814
I told you not to call me by my name.

392
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:26,224
I'm not your friend.

393
00:22:27,955 --> 00:22:29,066
Sorry.

394
00:22:31,624 --> 00:22:32,735
Beat it.

395
00:22:33,424 --> 00:22:35,231
- What?
- Come on.

396
00:22:35,255 --> 00:22:37,278
Ae Seol, you should go.

397
00:22:37,465 --> 00:22:38,565
Go.

398
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,570
Calm down. You scared her.

399
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:43,168
- Ae Seol. Bye.
- Ae Seol. Bye.

400
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:45,870
You guys are so mean.

401
00:22:45,894 --> 00:22:47,458
- Hey, be nice to her.
- What?

402
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,204
Hey.

403
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:55,085
Let's go inside.

404
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:56,630
Ma'am.

405
00:22:56,654 --> 00:22:58,721
- Hello.
- Hello.

406
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,011
Hello.

407
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:01,816
Go in already.

408
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:03,345
It smells.

409
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:07,140
- I told you that!
- No!

410
00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:09,021
- You should be in your seats!
- Hurry.

411
00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:10,981
- Come on.
- I'm late.

412
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:12,441
- Is that good?
- Goodness.

413
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:13,731
That's your problem.

414
00:23:13,755 --> 00:23:14,855
Stop it!

415
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,900
- Attention.
- Gosh.

416
00:23:17,924 --> 00:23:19,031
- Come on.
- Be quiet!

417
00:23:19,055 --> 00:23:20,451
Attention!

418
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:22,531
I have a present for you.

419
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:29,425
The report cards for the mock test from September.

420
00:23:31,434 --> 00:23:32,820
And there is one more thing.

421
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,541
I'll distribute them in the order of your scores.

422
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:36,001
- What?
- Come on.

423
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:37,711
- That's not right.
- No!

424
00:23:37,735 --> 00:23:38,880
- You can't do that.
- Ma'am.

425
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:41,568
- Be quiet!
- I don't want that!

426
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:43,728
When I call your name, come up here.

427
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:45,483
Let me begin.

428
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,880
First place in our class as well as the entire senior class.

429
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:50,095
Young Hoon.

430
00:23:51,455 --> 00:23:52,566
Give a round of applause.

431
00:23:59,465 --> 00:24:00,895
Young Soo, second place.

432
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:05,502
- Young Soo.
- Young Soo.

433
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:06,820
Yu Jung, third place.

434
00:24:06,844 --> 00:24:08,177
- Class President!
- Nice.

435
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:10,667
- Young Sin.
- Gosh.

436
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:12,710
- Thank you.
- Yeon Ju.

437
00:24:12,775 --> 00:24:13,961
- Hey.
- Hey.

438
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,130
- Jang Soo, good job.
- You did so well, Yeon Ju.

439
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,254
- So jealous.
- Na Ra.

440
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:18,992
(Report Card for September Mock Test)

441
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:21,761
All right. Two students came in last with the same mark.

442
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:24,301
- Let's not humiliate them!
- Right!

443
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:26,090
There are only two of you. What's the point?

444
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:27,500
Il Ha. Hee Rak. Come on up.

445
00:24:29,995 --> 00:24:31,471
- A round of applause, everyone!
- They came in last.

446
00:24:31,495 --> 00:24:33,156
Gosh. Unbelievable.

447
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:35,434
Seriously.

448
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:36,815
Thank you.

449
00:24:37,215 --> 00:24:38,315
Thank you.

450
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,099
Let's study harder next time.

451
00:24:42,344 --> 00:24:43,763
- Okay.
- Okay.

452
00:24:50,225 --> 00:24:51,644
Hey, you two!

453
00:24:55,184 --> 00:24:59,170
Can every single teacher please come...

454
00:24:59,194 --> 00:25:01,301
to the teachers' office immediately?

455
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:03,018
I will repeat.

456
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,931
Can every single teacher please come...

457
00:25:06,955 --> 00:25:08,835
- to the teachers' office?
- That's all.

458
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:10,535
Prepare for class.

459
00:25:11,535 --> 00:25:13,196
Hand in your phones!

460
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:15,925
- Okay.
- Oh, darn it.

461
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:17,882
Hand in your phones!

462
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:21,614
- Hand in your phones.
- Do as you're told.

463
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:24,492
Come on.

464
00:25:25,384 --> 00:25:27,135
- Give me a few minutes.
- No.

465
00:25:30,144 --> 00:25:34,041
Hey. Better luck next time.

466
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,620
- Kimchi.
- What?

467
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:37,395
See what's going on.

468
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:38,928
In the teachers' office?

469
00:25:40,944 --> 00:25:42,090
Me?

470
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:44,435
Excuse me.

471
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:48,262
Go, now.

472
00:25:48,705 --> 00:25:50,949
Okay. I'll go.

473
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:55,293
Why? Do you have a hunch?

474
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:57,448
I have this real bad feeling.

475
00:25:58,715 --> 00:25:59,946
I don't like it.

476
00:26:10,594 --> 00:26:11,701
What?

477
00:26:11,725 --> 00:26:14,024
This is too sudden.

478
00:26:14,354 --> 00:26:16,451
And the seniors...

479
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:17,791
Ms. Park.

480
00:26:17,815 --> 00:26:22,080
My goodness. Ms. Park.

481
00:26:22,104 --> 00:26:23,393
Let's go back upstairs.

482
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:27,149
Chi Yeol.

483
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:35,060
It doesn't work.

484
00:26:35,084 --> 00:26:36,271
It looks like...

485
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:38,582
Hey. Wait, isn't it time for class?

486
00:26:39,584 --> 00:26:41,148
What a loser.

487
00:26:46,634 --> 00:26:47,824
Guys.

488
00:26:52,765 --> 00:26:55,370
- The rolling admission's cancelled.
- What?

489
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:57,370
- What...
- What do you mean?

490
00:26:57,394 --> 00:26:58,580
Is something wrong?

491
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:00,001
- What?
- Why cancel that?

492
00:27:00,025 --> 00:27:02,544
- That's weird.
- Ms. Park. Are you serious?

493
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,693
What's the matter?

494
00:27:05,315 --> 00:27:06,751
Are you sure?

495
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:08,801
Does that go for all high schools?

496
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:11,301
What happens to people who applied?

497
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:12,798
Wait a minute.

498
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:15,912
This is nonsense.

499
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:21,486
Yes, we scored.

500
00:27:21,664 --> 00:27:24,150
No, cancelling rolling admissions isn't enough.

501
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:25,691
Don't we need the CSAT to be cancelled?

502
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:27,409
That's what we want.

503
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:29,523
Will you hear me out?

504
00:27:30,055 --> 00:27:31,991
Only the rolling admissions got cancelled.

505
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,215
The CSAT will happen as scheduled.

506
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:35,636
The CSAT's on?

507
00:27:35,765 --> 00:27:37,051
And...

508
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:56,230
I'll explain slowly if you all concentrate.

509
00:27:57,834 --> 00:28:00,060
The Minister of National Defence will release...

510
00:28:00,084 --> 00:28:02,941
a statement regarding the Student Reserve Forces.

511
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:06,231
We'll head over to a reporter who's on site.

512
00:28:06,255 --> 00:28:07,861
Oh Eun Ji will report.

513
00:28:08,884 --> 00:28:11,781
I'm outside the briefing room at the Ministry of National Defence.

514
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:14,830
An emergency announcement will soon be made.

515
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:19,041
Minister Park Sang Man just stepped onto the podium.

516
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,951
Let's hear what he has to say.

517
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:22,636
(Ministry of National Defence)

518
00:28:27,654 --> 00:28:28,888
I'm Minister Park Sang Man.

519
00:28:29,654 --> 00:28:33,735
It has been a year since the unidentified spheres...

520
00:28:33,825 --> 00:28:35,200
appeared in our skies.

521
00:28:35,664 --> 00:28:38,721
As of now, we cannot determine the level of threat,

522
00:28:38,745 --> 00:28:41,140
- but at any moment...
- Isn't a minister high up?

523
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:43,595
- Super high up.
- To be prepared,

524
00:28:43,624 --> 00:28:48,560
please understand we must issue a nationwide mobilization order.

525
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:49,731
- A what?
- A nationwide...

526
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:52,791
Other than military personnel who are currently serving,

527
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:54,553
those who will soon be drafted,

528
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:56,572
military reservists,

529
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:59,936
male and female adults up to the age of 24,

530
00:29:00,644 --> 00:29:01,878
and...

531
00:29:03,985 --> 00:29:06,910
those who are currently high-school seniors...

532
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:08,712
will all be mobilized.

533
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:09,751
High-school seniors?

534
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:11,001
- Us?
- Us?

535
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,461
- Why us?
- What about the CSAT?

536
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:13,971
- Why us?
- What does that mean?

537
00:29:13,995 --> 00:29:15,261
What happens to us seniors?

538
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:16,747
Be quiet so I can listen.

539
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:20,578
Students will be contacted through their schools.

540
00:29:21,374 --> 00:29:22,938
We have no choice...

541
00:29:23,914 --> 00:29:25,731
but to cancel the rolling admissions...

542
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:28,731
to all universities and colleges...

543
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:30,481
for the year 2023.

544
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:31,650
They're cancelled?

545
00:29:31,674 --> 00:29:34,191
It must be for real. It's all over the internet.

546
00:29:34,215 --> 00:29:36,547
We hope to keep regular admissions open as scheduled.

547
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:40,592
High-school seniors will receive military training...

548
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:42,597
besides their regular classes.

549
00:29:42,934 --> 00:29:46,740
The government has decided to grant extra points...

550
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:51,090
to students who agree to receive military training.

551
00:29:51,114 --> 00:29:53,301
- What does that mean?
- We'll discuss the extra points...

552
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,887
with the Ministry of Education...

553
00:29:55,944 --> 00:29:57,681
We have classes and military training?

554
00:29:57,705 --> 00:30:00,080
What's this about military training and extra points?

555
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:04,140
- We still have to take the CSAT?
- What a stupid question.

556
00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:05,451
It doesn't make sense.

557
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:09,287
Silence!

558
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:10,614
Silence.

559
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:13,900
As you just heard, there will be military training...

560
00:30:13,924 --> 00:30:16,544
apart from your regular classes.

561
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:21,050
The government says you're categorized as reservists.

562
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:24,932
You're reserve forces,

563
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:26,613
so don't worry too much.

564

(Performance assessment, 12th Grade, Sungjin High School)

565
00:30:32,735 --> 00:30:34,420
Yu Jung, hand these out.

566
00:30:34,444 --> 00:30:35,634
Okay.

567
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:38,645
What's that?

568
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:41,808
- It must be for real.
- What about the CSAT?

569
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:46,850
- Hey, move it!
- Move faster.

570
00:30:46,874 --> 00:30:48,282
(Military Training Consent Form)

571
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:51,184
What the heck?

572
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,400
- Be quick.
- Sorry.

573
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:55,305
That's a military training consent form.

574
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:57,150
Show it to your parents.

575
00:30:57,174 --> 00:30:58,870
- For real?
- No way.

576
00:30:58,884 --> 00:31:01,701
Ms. Park. We must camp together?

577
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:04,620
What happens to people who don't sign this?

578
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:06,160
I'm not sure,

579
00:31:06,184 --> 00:31:08,571
but it'll be replaced with a remote learning class.

580
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:11,895
How many extra points do we get?

581
00:31:12,354 --> 00:31:15,130
Is there a differential system?

582
00:31:15,154 --> 00:31:17,169
The details will come out later.

583
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,215
I'll share as soon as I hear from the Ministry of Education.

584
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:23,051
What I am sure about is that only those...

585
00:31:23,075 --> 00:31:25,968
who apply for military training get extra points.

586
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:29,560
Get the form signed if you want them.

587
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,981
Ms. Park. What about people who'll major in performing arts?

588
00:31:32,005 --> 00:31:34,400
Are we going to war?

589
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:36,070
What if we're skipping college?

590
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,400
How long will the training last?

591
00:31:37,424 --> 00:31:38,570
What if we quit halfway through?

592
00:31:38,594 --> 00:31:41,157
Where will the training take place?

593
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:46,719
I know you're flustered and in shock.

594
00:31:48,184 --> 00:31:49,605
I am too.

595
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:51,761
But...

596
00:31:53,894 --> 00:31:55,280
let's not worry.

597
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:59,624
Keep studying hard and stick with the military training too.

598
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:02,622
Just keep doing what you always did.

599
00:32:03,285 --> 00:32:04,721
Don't forget the years of work...

600
00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:07,637
you put in to go to a good university.

601
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:10,608
Okay?

602
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:14,130
What the heck...

603
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,400
- Study hard!
- What?

604
00:32:22,424 --> 00:32:24,241
- Ms. Park, we're not...
- Ms. Park!

605
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:26,160
- Ms. Park.
- Explain what's going on!

606
00:32:26,184 --> 00:32:28,021
- What's happening?
- Ms. Park!

607
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:52,839
Hey, look at this.

608
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:55,100
"Worst national defence crisis since the constitution."

609
00:32:55,124 --> 00:32:57,650
- This means there will be war.
- No way.

610
00:32:57,674 --> 00:33:00,271
Why does it have to be high-school seniors?

611
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:01,400
What about the others?

612
00:33:01,424 --> 00:33:04,070
I know. Shouldn't we be exempt so we can study?

613
00:33:04,094 --> 00:33:05,531
That's more fair.

614
00:33:05,555 --> 00:33:07,248
To us, college is everything.

615
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:11,374
How hard would we train if they offered up extra points?

616
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:12,951
That's why it's us.

617
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:16,099
For the first time in your life, you sounded convincing.

618
00:33:18,354 --> 00:33:20,512
They won't suddenly start a war, will they?

619
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:22,551
- Against what?
- Them.

620
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:24,221
- Against them?
- Yes.

621
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:26,090
It would look pathetic to go to war...

622
00:33:26,114 --> 00:33:28,261
- against balloons.
- Would it?

623
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:29,847
It's true!

624
00:33:31,285 --> 00:33:33,991
What? You got it too?

625
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:35,805
For real?

626
00:33:38,465 --> 00:33:41,490
I don't know. Maybe we'll fight the balloons.

627
00:33:41,545 --> 00:33:42,731
Bye.

628
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:44,191
Shut your mouth. Bye.

629
00:33:44,215 --> 00:33:46,195
Take care. See you.

630
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:49,928
It must be for real.

631
00:33:50,555 --> 00:33:54,691
Hey. If you're done, skip off to your own seat.

632
00:33:58,735 --> 00:33:59,966
I don't want to.

633
00:34:01,275 --> 00:34:03,475
There's a penalty for not handing in your phone.

634
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:10,887
If I beat you to a pulp,

635
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:14,116
how many penalty points do I get?

636
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:19,101
What? Are you scared?

637
00:34:26,305 --> 00:34:28,911
- Darn you.
- Oh, no!

638
00:34:34,564 --> 00:34:36,535
You scumbag.

639
00:34:37,524 --> 00:34:40,274
- Stop them.
- You stop them!

640
00:34:47,114 --> 00:34:48,634
Darn you.

641
00:34:48,694 --> 00:34:50,431
- You scumbag.
- You scumbag.

642
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,730
What?

643
00:34:52,575 --> 00:34:55,556
Stop them! Do something!

644
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:06,150
You're all so annoying!

645
00:35:06,174 --> 00:35:08,070
- Come at me!
- Darn you.

646
00:35:08,094 --> 00:35:09,557
Screw you.

647
00:35:10,094 --> 00:35:11,658
- Stop it!
- Let go!

648
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:20,101
What, dirtbag? What?

649
00:35:21,484 --> 00:35:22,718
My gosh...

650
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,577
Hey. Soldiers.

651
00:35:38,044 --> 00:35:39,234
Guys.

652
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:43,944
What?

653
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:53,009
What are they doing here?

654
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:55,635
- I don't know.
- It must be that.

655
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:13,839
All personnel and firearms accounted for.

656
00:36:14,915 --> 00:36:16,051
Unpack the firearms first.

657
00:36:16,075 --> 00:36:18,055
The rest, head indoors.

658
00:36:21,504 --> 00:36:22,561
We're screwed.

659
00:36:22,585 --> 00:36:24,102
I should call Mom.

660
00:36:31,964 --> 00:36:33,360
It looks serious.

661
00:36:33,384 --> 00:36:34,484
What's going on?

662
00:36:34,765 --> 00:36:36,241
- Unbelievable.
- We just found out about it.

663
00:36:36,265 --> 00:36:37,871
They can't be here for us.

664
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:58,733
(Band-aids)

665
00:37:02,044 --> 00:37:03,375
(Band-aids)

666
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:10,144
Are you all right?

667
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:12,905
About what?

668
00:37:14,214 --> 00:37:17,021
You fought earlier.

669
00:37:19,555 --> 00:37:20,655
So,

670
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:24,885
the kids in our class are nice if you get to know them.

671
00:37:24,895 --> 00:37:26,500
You could become friends or...

672
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:27,943
I don't want to make friends.

673
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:30,873
We're just passing acquaintances.

674
00:37:31,904 --> 00:37:34,471
You meet and befriend people like you after school.

675
00:37:34,495 --> 00:37:35,595
That's easier.

676
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:38,399
You don't have to be so considerate or cautious.

677
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:40,920
People who will benefit me.

678
00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:42,885
Those are my friends.

679
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:47,463
Oh, I see.

680
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:50,604
Is that it?

681
00:37:53,844 --> 00:37:57,564
Will you sign the military training consent form?

682
00:37:57,765 --> 00:37:58,865
I can't sign it.

683
00:38:02,265 --> 00:38:03,783
My parents have to.

684
00:38:12,614 --> 00:38:13,714
See you.

685
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:17,616
Mom.

686
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:21,601
Who will care for your siblings if you go to training camp?

687
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,825
Mom and Dad leave for work at dawn.

688
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,850
Can't you just study at home?

689
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:30,257
The other kids will get extra points.

690
00:38:30,464 --> 00:38:32,939
One point could mean an Ivy League school.

691
00:38:33,174 --> 00:38:35,940
No rolling admissions means I have a much better chance.

692
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:38,650
I'm worried about the younger kids.

693
00:38:38,674 --> 00:38:41,437
Why should I always sacrifice for them?

694
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:44,455
Sign it.

695
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:46,833
Okay, fine.

696
00:38:53,484 --> 00:38:54,727
You said you'd be late.

697
00:38:55,154 --> 00:38:57,079
Yes, but I left early.

698
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:00,735
You said...

699
00:39:01,154 --> 00:39:02,760
you'd draw cartoons or something.

700
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,641
You don't need a college degree.

701
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:06,681
Staying alone at home will be so boring.

702
00:39:06,705 --> 00:39:08,025
I'd rather be with the others.

703
00:39:09,504 --> 00:39:10,738
Okay, then.

704
00:39:14,544 --> 00:39:16,730
Don't sleep out because I'm not home.

705
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,900
And don't go clubbing as much.

706
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:22,555
My gosh. Listen, I'm your mom and it's my life to live.

707
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:25,495
Cheers.

708
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,783
(Military Training Consent Form)

709
00:39:29,395 --> 00:39:30,661
I don't want to go.

710
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:32,581
Why bother when I can't go to college anyway?

711
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:34,290
Whether you go to college or not,

712
00:39:34,314 --> 00:39:38,076
I can't stand the sight of you doing nothing at home.

713
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:39,609
Can we have another soju?

714
00:39:39,864 --> 00:39:41,428
Yes, of course.

715
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:43,934
There will be this online class.

716
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:46,651
You don't even study at school.

717
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:50,459
I'll be darned if I believe you'd study at home.

718
00:39:50,754 --> 00:39:51,854
Go to training.

719
00:39:57,044 --> 00:39:58,157
But I don't want to.

720
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:06,556
Do your best.

721
00:40:07,145 --> 00:40:09,939
Do all you can to get extra points.

722
00:40:10,395 --> 00:40:14,618
Raise your hand and volunteer for training, okay?

723
00:40:16,404 --> 00:40:18,090
Now you must compete with...

724
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:20,503
all the gifted kids from the special high schools.

725
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:23,471
Don't you fail to get into Seoul National University...

726
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:24,801
over a few points.

727
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:26,805
Okay, so stop it.

728
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,480
This is such an important time...

729
00:40:33,504 --> 00:40:35,154
and you got into a fight?

730
00:40:38,344 --> 00:40:40,126
I said I fell.

731
00:40:41,844 --> 00:40:43,263
- I'll take it.
- But...

732
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:45,689
Okay, good.

733
00:40:46,265 --> 00:40:48,839
Don't take too long a break, okay?

734
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:54,131
Okay, Private Ryan.

735
00:40:58,024 --> 00:41:01,710
He's packing excitedly, of course.

736
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:02,834
Here.

737
00:41:04,444 --> 00:41:05,876
Why are you taking this?

738
00:41:06,075 --> 00:41:09,430
Mom, this is the most precious one.

739
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,804
You fool.

740
00:41:11,995 --> 00:41:14,426
You're my son, but you're such an embarrassment.

741
00:41:14,714 --> 00:41:16,683
Oh. No, not at all.

742
00:41:16,754 --> 00:41:18,316
I'm worried, of course.

743
00:41:18,674 --> 00:41:19,906
But what can I do?

744
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,690
They have to do it.

745
00:41:21,714 --> 00:41:22,957
- Yes.
- Okay.

746
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,314
Yes.

747
00:41:25,475 --> 00:41:28,775
We must trust them when they say school's safer.

748
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:30,785
Okay, bye.

749
00:41:32,564 --> 00:41:35,081
You need things like this when you train.

750
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:36,621
The more, the better.

751
00:41:36,645 --> 00:41:39,724
It's just four weeks. I'll never use all this up.

752
00:41:42,575 --> 00:41:43,675
Dad.

753
00:41:43,785 --> 00:41:44,885
What will we do?

754
00:41:44,944 --> 00:41:47,331
You'll do things like run,

755
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:50,781
learn how to pack your bags, and shoot.

756
00:41:52,705 --> 00:41:54,861
Don't you worry.

757
00:41:55,254 --> 00:41:56,807
You're like me, so you'll do fine.

758
00:41:57,714 --> 00:41:59,320
When I was in the army,

759
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:02,366
I was a top marksman and model squad leader.

760
00:42:03,424 --> 00:42:06,218
Mom said you didn't go to the actual army.

761
00:42:09,265 --> 00:42:12,158
Go on, help him pack.

762
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:17,827
You'll be with your friends,

763
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:21,037
so do as the soldiers say,

764
00:42:21,154 --> 00:42:22,573
and eat well.

765
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,352
Don't get hurt.

766
00:42:26,654 --> 00:42:29,780
Are you crying? Why would you cry?

767
00:42:35,245 --> 00:42:37,676
Chi Yeol, look after yourself.

768
00:42:37,754 --> 00:42:40,351
Just come back healthy and safely, okay?

769
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:42,079
Don't worry.

770
00:42:44,844 --> 00:42:48,001
Will you just sign this for me?

771
00:42:48,594 --> 00:42:49,694
Darn it.

772
00:42:57,225 --> 00:43:01,250
Why are you crying when he's not going off to his death?

773
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:03,199
What if he does?

774
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:08,355
Whatever.

775
00:43:12,995 --> 00:43:14,832
I'm not going off to die.

776
00:43:15,915 --> 00:43:17,378
Why make a fuss?

777
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:28,226
(Let's go to university!)

778
00:43:41,944 --> 00:43:43,363
Move it.

779
00:43:45,774 --> 00:43:46,750
Hey.

780
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:47,920
Hello.

781
00:43:47,944 --> 00:43:49,840
- Just a quick photo.
- Leave it.

782
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:50,964
Salute!

(Sungjin High School)

784
00:43:55,495 --> 00:43:56,914
Hello, there.

785
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:58,721
- You filled it in?
- Yes.

786
00:43:58,745 --> 00:43:59,845
Awesome.

787
00:44:00,665 --> 00:44:02,561
Do Yoon, did you fill it in?

788
00:44:02,585 --> 00:44:04,311
That's insane.

789
00:44:04,335 --> 00:44:06,570
I'll come for kimchi stew afterwards.

790
00:44:06,594 --> 00:44:07,570
Hey.

791
00:44:07,594 --> 00:44:08,969
Good morning!

792
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:12,400
Go away, will you?

793
00:44:12,424 --> 00:44:14,406
- One, two, three.
- One...

794
00:44:14,725 --> 00:44:16,837
Gosh, you brought a lot of stuff.

795
00:44:17,105 --> 00:44:20,031
Most of them filled in the form.

796
00:44:22,105 --> 00:44:24,210
My mom hates the idea of me...

797
00:44:24,234 --> 00:44:26,210
not going to college more than going to training.

798
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:29,301
Mine too. I was so shocked.

799
00:44:29,325 --> 00:44:32,670
Ha Na, are you emigrating? Why did you bring two suitcases?

800
00:44:32,694 --> 00:44:34,971
I had a hard time cutting them down to two.

801
00:44:34,995 --> 00:44:36,964
I only brought half my makeup.

802
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:40,413
Did you set up a chewing gum store?

803
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:41,725
Yes.

804
00:44:41,794 --> 00:44:43,125
My post-meal dessert.

805
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,045
To freshen my palate.

806
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:49,581
Do you want one?

807
00:44:49,714 --> 00:44:52,695
- Hey! Just brush your teeth!
- Hey! Just brush your teeth!

808
00:44:53,475 --> 00:44:55,256
You're disgusting.

809
00:44:55,435 --> 00:44:57,492
- Go away.
- How gross.

810
00:45:01,935 --> 00:45:04,135
Why are you acting like you need to pee?

811
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:07,852
It's nothing.

812
00:45:10,154 --> 00:45:11,254
Hi, Na Ra.

813
00:45:20,955 --> 00:45:22,055
You!

814
00:45:22,915 --> 00:45:24,113
You...

815
00:45:25,214 --> 00:45:28,239
- What about me?
- Your face turned red.

816
00:45:28,835 --> 00:45:29,935
What?

817
00:45:30,134 --> 00:45:31,480
- Na Ra!
- Don't.

818
00:45:31,504 --> 00:45:33,022
Don't you dare.

819
00:45:34,714 --> 00:45:36,190
Go to your seats.

820
00:45:39,185 --> 00:45:40,285
Kwon Il Ha.

821
00:45:41,475 --> 00:45:42,575
Did you sleep well?

822
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:48,955
Listen up.

823
00:45:48,984 --> 00:45:51,602
There's someone you need to meet.

824
00:45:54,575 --> 00:45:55,675
Salute.

825
00:45:58,705 --> 00:45:59,805
Nice to meet you.

826
00:46:00,455 --> 00:46:02,974
I'm Lieutenant Lee Chun Ho, your platoon commander,

827
00:46:03,245 --> 00:46:04,345
in charge of Class 3-2.

828
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,520
Lieutenant Lee...

829
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:08,900
will explain your training regime.

830
00:46:08,924 --> 00:46:11,531
There's a diamond on his forehead.

831
00:46:15,424 --> 00:46:18,955
You are Sungjin High Battalion Combat Platoon Two.

832
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:22,183
I'm your commander.

833
00:46:22,225 --> 00:46:24,581
Most of the training will happen...

834
00:46:24,605 --> 00:46:27,040
in the evening, after your regular classes.

835
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:29,290
- What? After school?
- No way.

836
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:31,063
- After school?
- I need to play games.

837
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:33,123
If there's a special agenda,

838
00:46:33,234 --> 00:46:35,302
training will take priority.

839
00:46:35,654 --> 00:46:37,348
Keep that in mind.

840
00:46:37,785 --> 00:46:38,885
Class president.

841
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:40,635
Yes?

842
00:46:41,995 --> 00:46:43,832
You're the Senior Private.

843
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:46,260
- What?
- What does that mean?

844
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:47,975
I don't know.

845
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,273
- Do you know?
- What's a Senior Private?

846
00:46:50,544 --> 00:46:54,075
Next, I'll select a clerk who'll record your training...

847
00:46:54,174 --> 00:46:57,894
as well as your videos to send home.

848
00:46:58,844 --> 00:46:59,820
Any volunteers?

849
00:46:59,844 --> 00:47:01,781
Hey, look away. Don't look at him.

850
00:47:01,805 --> 00:47:04,148
- You do it.
- Are you crazy? Why me?

851
00:47:04,225 --> 00:47:05,201
Don't volunteer.

852
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:06,325
No one?

853
00:47:07,605 --> 00:47:08,749
Broadcasting Club, anyone?

854
00:47:12,105 --> 00:47:13,840
Then I'll randomly select...

855
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,646
Mr. Commander?

856
00:47:16,524 --> 00:47:18,317
Can I recommend someone?

857
00:47:20,654 --> 00:47:21,754
Young Hoon.

858
00:47:22,364 --> 00:47:23,464
Will you have a go?

859
00:47:24,165 --> 00:47:25,265
Me?

860
00:47:26,035 --> 00:47:28,290
Yes. I think you'd learn a lot...

861
00:47:28,455 --> 00:47:30,203
from the experience.

862
00:47:32,585 --> 00:47:34,190
What should I learn?

863
00:47:35,594 --> 00:47:38,707
Jang Young Hoon. Just do it. It's not a big deal.

864
00:47:40,174 --> 00:47:41,461
Then you do it.

865
00:47:42,475 --> 00:47:44,675
Give it a go and if you don't like it,

866
00:47:45,105 --> 00:47:46,524
I'll let you swap.

867
00:47:47,605 --> 00:47:48,749
I have to study.

868
00:47:49,145 --> 00:47:50,618
I don't want to waste my time.

869
00:47:50,685 --> 00:47:52,895
Gosh, what a punk.

870
00:47:53,444 --> 00:47:54,676
That's fine.

871
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:58,386
I told you he's weird.

872
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:59,675
What a piece of work.

873
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:03,979
You there, Private.

874
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,074
He means you, idiot.

875
00:48:18,504 --> 00:48:20,650
Who... Me?

876
00:48:20,674 --> 00:48:22,005
You're the clerk.

877
00:48:22,424 --> 00:48:23,524
Any objections?

878
00:48:25,055 --> 00:48:26,155
Well...

879
00:48:26,594 --> 00:48:27,581
No.

880
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:29,893
You get three bonus points.

881
00:48:30,015 --> 00:48:31,621
- What?
- What?

882
00:48:31,645 --> 00:48:33,460
So does the Senior Private.

883
00:48:33,484 --> 00:48:34,670
What?

884
00:48:34,694 --> 00:48:37,125
- Just like that?
- So many points?

885
00:48:37,364 --> 00:48:40,136
There's a bonus point system separate to the extra CSAT points.

886
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:42,920
You'll be scored for your attitude and aptitude,

887
00:48:42,944 --> 00:48:47,082
and ten bonus points equals one extra CSAT point.

888
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:49,701
Accumulate 30 penalty points and you'll be discharged.

889
00:48:50,205 --> 00:48:53,417
All the extra CSAT points you earned will be scrubbed.

890
00:48:53,835 --> 00:48:55,671
- What?
- What the heck?

891
00:48:58,134 --> 00:48:59,570
- Darn it.
- Then...

892
00:48:59,594 --> 00:49:01,400
we'll head to the dormitory.

893
00:49:01,424 --> 00:49:02,524
The dormitory?

894
00:49:02,555 --> 00:49:04,070
- Where's that?
- What?

895
00:49:04,094 --> 00:49:05,513
A dormitory?

896
00:49:05,844 --> 00:49:06,944
We have one?

897
00:49:12,975 --> 00:49:14,998
Go away!

898
00:49:15,694 --> 00:49:17,670
- I told you.
- Get moving, you jerk.

899
00:49:17,694 --> 00:49:19,670
- Hey!
- Ouch. Get lost.

900
00:49:19,694 --> 00:49:21,938
- Darn you.
- Go!

901
00:49:21,984 --> 00:49:23,546
Hurry up, will you?

902
00:49:24,825 --> 00:49:26,971
Each locker has a name on it. Find your name.

903
00:49:26,995 --> 00:49:28,511
That's your spot.

904
00:49:28,535 --> 00:49:29,866
Get moving quickly.

905
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:33,188
- Hello.
- Hey. He said "quickly."

906
00:49:34,544 --> 00:49:36,240
- Look at my bowl.
- Here's mine.

907
00:49:36,504 --> 00:49:38,730
- Hey!
- Look, that's us!

908
00:49:38,754 --> 00:49:41,141
- Hey!
- Nice!

909
00:49:42,555 --> 00:49:46,201
Darn it. I can't sleep on a bad mattress.

910
00:49:46,225 --> 00:49:50,411
As if. You always sleep at your desk and drool all over it.

911
00:49:50,435 --> 00:49:54,516
Hey, don't you feel like we're here to shoot "Real Men?"

912
00:49:54,855 --> 00:49:56,230
Oh, you're right.

913
00:49:56,605 --> 00:49:57,871
Private Woo Hee Rak!

914
00:49:57,895 --> 00:50:00,250
- Private First Class Wang Tae Man!
- Kim Duk Joong!

915
00:50:00,274 --> 00:50:01,473
Let's go!

916
00:50:04,194 --> 00:50:05,294
Attention.

917
00:50:07,364 --> 00:50:09,709
Oh, no!

918
00:50:16,455 --> 00:50:18,601
Unpack and get settled in quickly.

919
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:21,385
We will distribute firearms in the field.

920
00:50:22,924 --> 00:50:25,819
Assemble in the field in exactly 30 minutes from now.

921
00:50:26,214 --> 00:50:27,371
Do you understand?

922
00:50:30,435 --> 00:50:33,141
Yes. We got it, sir!

923
00:50:33,555 --> 00:50:35,260
- Yes, sir.
- Hey.

924
00:50:39,734 --> 00:50:40,834
That's all for now.

925
00:50:45,864 --> 00:50:47,511
You little...

926
00:50:47,535 --> 00:50:48,866
Bye.

927
00:50:49,575 --> 00:50:51,840
"Assemble in exactly 30 minutes from now. Go!"

928
00:50:51,864 --> 00:50:52,891
Yes!

929
00:50:52,915 --> 00:50:54,721
- Hey, did you see that jerk's name?
- What is it?

930
00:50:54,745 --> 00:50:56,395
- His name is Won Bin!
- Won Bin?

931
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,948
Why is he so tanned?

932
00:50:59,085 --> 00:51:00,730
Was it always this big?

933
00:51:00,754 --> 00:51:02,440
Hey, I brought this.

934
00:51:02,464 --> 00:51:03,650
I brought this too.

935
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:06,190
- Great minds think alike!
- Yes!

936
00:51:06,214 --> 00:51:07,900
- How many did you bring?
- I brought tons.

937
00:51:07,924 --> 00:51:09,781
Me too. We should eat it while we're here.

938
00:51:09,805 --> 00:51:11,411
- Totally.
- My mom won't let me eat it.

939
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,741
Girls, what did you bring?

940
00:51:12,765 --> 00:51:14,161
I brought my perfume.

941
00:51:14,185 --> 00:51:16,540
- Oh! Can I smell it?
- It smells really good.

942
00:51:16,564 --> 00:51:17,701
- I want to smell it too.
- What do you think?

943
00:51:17,725 --> 00:51:19,710
- Hey, it smells so good!
- It smells really good.

944
00:51:19,734 --> 00:51:20,790
- Hey.
- I want some too.

945
00:51:20,814 --> 00:51:23,581
- Can I have some too?
- Girls, I brought my camera.

946
00:51:23,605 --> 00:51:26,170
- Nice!
- Let's take pictures.

947
00:51:26,194 --> 00:51:27,380
Gather around.

948
00:51:27,404 --> 00:51:30,761
All right, 1, 2, 3. Make a V!

949
00:51:32,415 --> 00:51:33,931
- No!
- Don't let anyone see them.

950
00:51:33,955 --> 00:51:35,971
- Don't reveal your cards.
- Only you can see them.

951
00:51:35,995 --> 00:51:38,294
But what is this?

952
00:51:38,585 --> 00:51:41,477
It's the November card. Double Junks.

953
00:51:42,254 --> 00:51:44,179
It's my grandma's favourite card.

954
00:51:44,214 --> 00:51:46,601
Put it here. It's the same month.

955
00:51:59,314 --> 00:52:00,504
You're a liar.

956
00:52:01,855 --> 00:52:03,097
You've done this before.

957
00:52:03,774 --> 00:52:04,964
Go on and play.

958
00:52:07,154 --> 00:52:10,410
Hey, girls. What does "personal firearms" mean?

959
00:52:11,404 --> 00:52:12,801
- I don't know.
- No idea.

960
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:14,681
Personal guns, you idiot.

961
00:52:14,705 --> 00:52:16,601
- I see. They're guns.
- Oh, look!

962
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:19,270
- Oh, my.
- That looks awesome.

963
00:52:19,294 --> 00:52:20,351
Hey, let's take lots of pictures.

964
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:22,211
- Attention.
- Hey, of course!

965
00:52:22,214 --> 00:52:24,270
- I told you.
- I told you too.

966
00:52:24,294 --> 00:52:26,360
- Attention!
- Goodness.

967
00:52:26,384 --> 00:52:28,628
Do you think this is a camping trip?

968
00:52:30,594 --> 00:52:32,451
Listen carefully.

969
00:52:32,475 --> 00:52:35,269
Any items that you won't need here...

970
00:52:35,594 --> 00:52:38,852
must be submitted at once.

971
00:52:38,935 --> 00:52:40,035
- What is this?
- No!

972
00:52:42,355 --> 00:52:45,540
- Curling irons, toys, lipsticks!
- Oh, no.

973
00:52:45,564 --> 00:52:48,457
Foundation, perfume... What? A scented candle?

974
00:52:49,024 --> 00:52:51,180
Your foundation, lipstick...

975
00:52:51,944 --> 00:52:53,051
You little...

976
00:52:53,075 --> 00:52:54,318
Hey, quick.

977
00:52:54,455 --> 00:52:56,555
- Don't move.
- Hide this, quick!

978
00:52:57,165 --> 00:52:58,716
What? Cigarettes?

979
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:03,126
Girls, get moving at once!

980
00:53:03,335 --> 00:53:04,480
Go!

981
00:53:04,504 --> 00:53:05,480
Hey, hurry!

982
00:53:05,504 --> 00:53:08,485
Submit them all. Why you little...

983
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:10,480
That moment, I just knew.

984
00:53:10,504 --> 00:53:12,820
(Hong Jun Hee, Park So Yoon)

985
00:53:12,844 --> 00:53:16,058
This is so wrong.

986
00:53:16,384 --> 00:53:20,104
Hey, can we take back our agreement?

987
00:53:21,015 --> 00:53:23,775
What? No one's doing that?

988
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:25,414
Gosh.

989
00:53:26,564 --> 00:53:28,357
- Darn it!
- Darn it!

990
00:53:30,314 --> 00:53:31,880
The seniors in the classrooms...

991
00:53:31,904 --> 00:53:34,011
Make sure you check the number of students.

992
00:53:34,035 --> 00:53:35,454
- Assemble at once.
- Yes, sir.

993
00:53:36,785 --> 00:53:38,897
- Once you check in...
- Move it!

994
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:40,851
- Hurry!
- Class Two!

995
00:53:40,875 --> 00:53:43,770
- Fall into one line.
- Form a line.

996
00:53:43,794 --> 00:53:45,400
Fall into one line.

997
00:53:45,585 --> 00:53:46,690
Hurry up!

998
00:53:46,714 --> 00:53:48,811
- Go, quick. This way.
- Class Two!

999
00:53:48,835 --> 00:53:51,496
- Hurry up.
- Fall into one line.

1000
00:53:52,214 --> 00:53:53,690
- Which class?
- Class Two!

1001
00:53:53,714 --> 00:53:55,595
- Hurry!
- Stand over here.

1002
00:53:56,055 --> 00:53:57,161
Attention.

1003
00:53:57,185 --> 00:53:59,991
We'll distribute firearms now, so focus!

1004
00:54:00,015 --> 00:54:02,633
Stay still, will you?

1005
00:54:04,064 --> 00:54:07,639
Hey, Young Hoon. Do you want to be a clerk?

1006
00:54:09,064 --> 00:54:12,870
Well, I don't really need the bonus points.

1007
00:54:13,444 --> 00:54:15,919
But you could really use some extra points.

1008
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:18,565
My gosh.

1009
00:54:19,614 --> 00:54:21,552
- But...
- Hey, Kimchi.

1010
00:54:21,745 --> 00:54:23,141
The platoon leader told you to do it.

1011
00:54:23,165 --> 00:54:25,321
Stop bugging him. You should just do it.

1012
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:28,440
Oh, okay.

1013
00:54:33,594 --> 00:54:36,531
When you receive your firearm, shout the serial number.

1014
00:54:36,555 --> 00:54:37,655
Do you understand?

1015
00:54:38,935 --> 00:54:40,739
I can barely hear you. Do you understand?

1016
00:54:40,765 --> 00:54:41,952
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1017
00:54:48,814 --> 00:54:51,113
Private Kim Yu Jung.

1018
00:54:51,274 --> 00:54:54,530
It's 701404.

1019
00:54:54,614 --> 00:54:55,758
Thank you.

1020
00:54:55,785 --> 00:54:59,721
Private Kim Duk Joong. Serial number 701403!

1021
00:54:59,745 --> 00:55:00,721
Next.

1022
00:55:00,745 --> 00:55:02,261
- Next.
- Next.

1023
00:55:02,285 --> 00:55:03,891
The weight's not bad.

1024
00:55:08,415 --> 00:55:11,011
Who said you could goof around with a firearm in your hand?

1025
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:12,541
Oh, I'm sorry.

1026
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,471
What makes them think they could give us guns?

1027
00:55:20,634 --> 00:55:21,879
- I wonder too.
- Next.

1028
00:55:23,435 --> 00:55:25,411
Private Kim Chi Yeol.

1029
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:28,871
Serial number 701406. That's it.

1030
00:55:28,895 --> 00:55:30,093
Next.

1031
00:55:43,575 --> 00:55:44,721
- Look at this.
- My gosh.

1032
00:55:44,745 --> 00:55:48,520
Gosh, it's so heavy. We have to carry it around all the time?

1033
00:55:48,544 --> 00:55:49,980
Right? It's nuts.

1034
00:55:50,004 --> 00:55:52,311
If we lose it, we get kicked out. We'll have to pay a fine too.

1035
00:55:52,335 --> 00:55:55,315
Hey, doesn't it look just like the ones you see in the game?

1036
00:55:55,504 --> 00:55:57,820
But they don't use the M16 rifle in the game.

1037
00:55:57,844 --> 00:56:00,638
There's too much rebound, and it's too loud.

1038
00:56:01,265 --> 00:56:03,161
Where does the M16 appear? 5 or 7?

1039
00:56:03,185 --> 00:56:06,672
Are you that dumb? You've played the game thousands of times.

1040
00:56:06,805 --> 00:56:08,048
It was Five.

1041
00:56:09,064 --> 00:56:10,750
Of course, you know everything about the game.

1042
00:56:10,774 --> 00:56:13,920
Darn, I wish I got the Kar98k. That's my specialty.

1043
00:56:13,944 --> 00:56:15,132
Hey.

1044
00:56:16,944 --> 00:56:18,088
Shut it and run.

1045
00:56:18,524 --> 00:56:19,637
No.

1046
00:56:20,864 --> 00:56:21,920
- Run.
- Go!

1047
00:56:21,944 --> 00:56:23,431
Hold on, guys. Give me just two seconds.

1048
00:56:23,455 --> 00:56:24,511
- Two seconds?
- Go!

1049
00:56:24,535 --> 00:56:27,285
- Go. Run!
- Just two seconds.

1050
00:56:27,455 --> 00:56:28,918
Go. Get him!

1051
00:56:29,165 --> 00:56:30,270
- What are you doing?
- Help me.

1052
00:56:30,294 --> 00:56:32,980
Hey, guys. Goodness. What are you doing?

1053
00:56:33,004 --> 00:56:34,690
- Oh, my.
- You little brats.

1054
00:56:34,714 --> 00:56:36,001
Hey, wait. Hey!

1055
00:56:36,174 --> 00:56:38,231
Hey, get back here. Goodness.

1056
00:56:38,254 --> 00:56:39,453
Sit back down!

1057
00:56:40,805 --> 00:56:41,820
- Move over.
- Hey!

1058
00:56:41,844 --> 00:56:43,177
Your break is over. Assemble.

1059
00:56:44,305 --> 00:56:45,955
You guys too. Assemble!

1060
00:56:48,435 --> 00:56:49,722
Come on down!

1061
00:56:50,145 --> 00:56:51,701
You guys, stop that and assemble!

1062
00:56:51,725 --> 00:56:53,110
Hey, old man!

1063
00:56:55,654 --> 00:56:56,842
"Old man?"

1064
00:56:56,855 --> 00:56:58,009
I'm not old!

1065
00:57:02,154 --> 00:57:05,135
I'm 21.

1066
00:57:05,665 --> 00:57:07,381
I'm only two years older than you guys.

1067
00:57:11,835 --> 00:57:13,715
I see. He's 21.

1068
00:57:14,504 --> 00:57:17,672
What's his deal? Anyone can tell he's 21.

1069
00:57:19,214 --> 00:57:20,732
- Hey, old man.
- Yes?

1070
00:57:22,424 --> 00:57:25,044
Can I get a clean one?

1071
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:26,451
This one looks used.

1072
00:57:26,475 --> 00:57:28,161
They're all used.

1073
00:57:28,185 --> 00:57:29,329
Come on down at once!

1074
00:57:30,015 --> 00:57:32,589
You guys, stop fooling around and assemble!

1075
00:57:34,145 --> 00:57:35,121
Come down at once.

1076
00:57:35,145 --> 00:57:36,706
- Gosh, that scared me.
- Assemble!

1077
00:57:36,944 --> 00:57:39,551
Assemble, everyone! Did you not hear me?

1078
00:57:41,114 --> 00:57:42,920
Assemble!

1079
00:57:42,944 --> 00:57:44,340
- Quick.
- Can you not hear me?

1080
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:45,739
What are you all doing?

1081
00:57:47,205 --> 00:57:48,305
Assemble!

1082
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:52,061
Did you not hear that? Assemble!

1083
00:57:52,085 --> 00:57:55,065
- Hurry up and come down.
- Hurry.

1084
00:58:06,384 --> 00:58:08,729
The firearms that you just received...

1085
00:58:09,805 --> 00:58:12,192
could save...

1086
00:58:15,774 --> 00:58:17,008
or kill you.

1087
00:58:23,444 --> 00:58:25,340
In times of emergency, the only thing you can trust...

1088
00:58:25,364 --> 00:58:27,883
isn't your friend or colleague next to you,

1089
00:58:30,825 --> 00:58:33,212
but your firearm in your hand.

1090
00:58:33,995 --> 00:58:35,699
So is it okay for you...

1091
00:58:38,835 --> 00:58:41,452
to handle it carelessly?

1092
00:58:46,344 --> 00:58:47,763
I am asking you guys.

1093
00:58:48,515 --> 00:58:50,902
- No, it's not okay.
- No, it's not okay.

1094
00:58:53,555 --> 00:58:54,831
See that goalpost over there?

1095
00:58:57,935 --> 00:58:59,089
The first three people.

1096
00:58:59,694 --> 00:59:01,081
- What?
- What's he talking about?

1097
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:02,205
Hey.

1098
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,473
Go.

1099
00:59:06,484 --> 00:59:08,971
- Don't. You'd better not run.
- No.

1100
00:59:08,995 --> 00:59:11,326
- Hey.
- Don't do it. Don't run.

1101
00:59:11,665 --> 00:59:14,141
- Hey.
- Hey, what's he doing?

1102
00:59:14,165 --> 00:59:16,061
- Gosh.
- Hey!

1103
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,270
Go!

1104
00:59:17,294 --> 00:59:18,715
- Hey!
- Don't run!

1105
00:59:19,464 --> 00:59:20,608
Run!

1106
00:59:21,674 --> 00:59:23,270
- Hey!
- Gosh.

1107
00:59:23,294 --> 00:59:24,581
Go faster!

1108
00:59:26,754 --> 00:59:27,911
Hey, wait up!

1109
00:59:28,094 --> 00:59:30,070
- Wait, hold on.
- Hey!

1110
00:59:30,094 --> 00:59:31,513
Come this way!

1111
00:59:31,515 --> 00:59:34,741
This way! Move it! Faster!

1112
00:59:34,765 --> 00:59:37,294
Now, the first five. Go!

1113
00:59:37,395 --> 00:59:40,121
Go, run! Only the first five!

1114
00:59:40,145 --> 00:59:42,170
Hey! Go faster.

1115
00:59:42,194 --> 00:59:44,482
- Hey! Wait up!
- Move it.

1116
00:59:46,194 --> 00:59:47,800
I'm so exhausted.

1117
00:59:48,154 --> 00:59:50,130
I feel like throwing up.

1118
00:59:50,154 --> 00:59:51,261
I feel like I'm dying right now.

1119
00:59:51,285 --> 00:59:54,122
- Hey.
- I'm dying.

1120
00:59:54,415 --> 00:59:55,746
Me too.

1121
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:59,231
- Gosh.
- I can't believe this.

1122
00:59:59,254 --> 01:00:02,270
- Hey, I'm dying.
- Me too.

1123
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:04,610
I'm dying because I'm so smitten by the platoon leader.

1124
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,020
He's totally my type!

1125
01:00:06,044 --> 01:00:09,900
Hey, what about that handsome guy on social media?

1126
01:00:09,924 --> 01:00:13,531
Oh, him. How should I put this? He's not mature enough.

1127
01:00:13,555 --> 01:00:16,161
Girls, look. Look at my rash!

1128
01:00:16,185 --> 01:00:19,045
This is what happens when I'm in the sun even for a short moment.

1129
01:00:19,064 --> 01:00:20,540
- What about me?
- What about me?

1130
01:00:20,564 --> 01:00:22,581
Hey, Yeon Bo Ra. I told you. Look at this!

1131
01:00:22,605 --> 01:00:23,960
Gosh, you're so loud.

1132
01:00:23,984 --> 01:00:26,184
I'm about to throw up, so be quiet.

1133
01:00:26,404 --> 01:00:27,636
What about me?

1134
01:00:28,194 --> 01:00:29,340
Your face is red.

1135
01:00:29,364 --> 01:00:31,203
- Why? Is it red?
- Yes.

1136
01:00:32,114 --> 01:00:34,314
- Look at this!
- It hurts.

1137
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:37,431
Why do I have to do this?

1138
01:00:37,455 --> 01:00:40,270
Darn it! Now that I think about it, those jerks make me so angry!

1139
01:00:40,294 --> 01:00:41,851
That jerk is crazy.

1140
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:43,641
Darn it. I'm fuming mad.

1141
01:00:43,665 --> 01:00:47,110
This is nuts.

1142
01:00:47,134 --> 01:00:49,360
Gosh, she's at it again.

1143
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:51,940
Lee Soon Yi is crying again!

1144
01:00:51,964 --> 01:00:54,201
Hey, please!

1145
01:00:54,225 --> 01:00:56,741
Girls, hand over your rifles. Don't leave them everywhere.

1146
01:00:56,765 --> 01:00:58,491
Look at my sun rash. What about my face?

1147
01:00:58,515 --> 01:01:01,331
Gosh, seriously!

1148
01:01:01,355 --> 01:01:03,161
- Look, my arm...
- Gosh.

1149
01:01:03,185 --> 01:01:04,889
Hey!

1150
01:01:05,694 --> 01:01:07,432
Do you want to do that race again?

1151
01:01:09,774 --> 01:01:12,667
Bring your rifles over here and organize them. Now.

1152
01:01:16,995 --> 01:01:19,426
- Gosh.
- Ouch...

1153
01:01:19,455 --> 01:01:20,681
Mom.

1154
01:01:20,705 --> 01:01:24,940
(Lee Soon Yi, Class 2)

1155
01:01:24,964 --> 01:01:26,020
Mom...

1156
01:01:26,044 --> 01:01:27,520
They tricked us.

1157
01:01:27,544 --> 01:01:29,440
(Hong Jun Hee, Class 2)

1158
01:01:29,464 --> 01:01:31,620
They said it'd be like a camping trip.

1159
01:01:31,924 --> 01:01:33,991
But it's like being in the real army!

1160
01:01:34,015 --> 01:01:35,911
Mom, Dad. Don't worry about me.

1161
01:01:35,935 --> 01:01:38,911
The platoon leader is very handsome and charismatic.

1162
01:01:38,935 --> 01:01:41,290
I'll listen to him and follow him around.

(Cho Jang Soo, Class 2)

1166
01:01:49,234 --> 01:01:50,422
I'll do a good job.

1167
01:01:51,274 --> 01:01:53,460
Oh. That's it?

1168
01:01:53,484 --> 01:01:54,815
Yes, that's it.

1169
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:59,601
Once I complete this, you have to buy me a motorcycle. Okay?

1170
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:03,391
Grandma, don't skip meals.

1171
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:05,181
And don't forget to take your medicine.

(No Ae Seol, Class 2)

1173
01:02:07,214 --> 01:02:10,283
I numbered them for you yesterday. Remember?

1174
01:02:10,835 --> 01:02:14,046
Don't forget to take them as you promised.

1175
01:02:14,714 --> 01:02:15,814
Okay?

1176
01:02:19,844 --> 01:02:20,951
- Gosh.
- Hey, look at this.

1177
01:02:20,975 --> 01:02:22,394
- Oh, my.
- That's nuts.

1178
01:02:24,855 --> 01:02:27,000
Hey, this is crazy! Gather around.

1179
01:02:27,024 --> 01:02:28,040
- What is it?
- What's going on?

1180
01:02:28,064 --> 01:02:29,254
Guys.

1181
01:02:29,694 --> 01:02:31,500
- What is it?
- What is it?

1182
01:02:31,524 --> 01:02:32,998
Guys, you need to see this.

1183
01:02:35,404 --> 01:02:38,011
They're here. What should we do?

1184
01:02:38,035 --> 01:02:39,222
Oh, no.

1185
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:44,261
What are you doing?

1186
01:02:44,285 --> 01:02:47,391
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry!

1187
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:49,650
What the... Isn't this fake?

1188
01:02:49,674 --> 01:02:50,774
Yes, it's got to be.

1189
01:02:50,924 --> 01:02:52,561
Why would soldiers kill animals?

1190
01:02:52,585 --> 01:02:54,333
This is totally fake.

1191
01:02:54,424 --> 01:02:55,568
No.

1192
01:02:56,055 --> 01:02:58,023
I've seen this before.

1193
01:03:03,765 --> 01:03:05,469
You see, one of the things...

1194
01:03:05,564 --> 01:03:08,161
that the government does before war breaks out...

1195
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:10,616
is getting rid of the animals in zoos.

1196
01:03:10,774 --> 01:03:13,249
Tigers, lions,

1197
01:03:13,364 --> 01:03:14,464
elephants!

1198
01:03:14,864 --> 01:03:17,064
They kill such vicious animals.

1199
01:03:18,245 --> 01:03:19,389
But why?

1200
01:03:21,455 --> 01:03:23,105
If starving animals escape,

1201
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:25,157
they'll eat people. That's why.

1202
01:03:27,085 --> 01:03:29,746
Then what about the animals that aren't vicious?

1203
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:34,017
Well, they'll be just left there to starve and die.

1204
01:03:34,754 --> 01:03:35,860
Starve to death, you idiot.

1205
01:03:35,884 --> 01:03:37,853
- Hey, let me eat the chips.
- Hold on.

1206
01:03:38,424 --> 01:03:40,008
If what Duk Joong is saying is true,

1207
01:03:40,475 --> 01:03:42,169
it means a war has broken out.

1208
01:03:45,685 --> 01:03:47,291
That's right.

1209
01:03:47,975 --> 01:03:51,737
It's either that, or it will begin very soon.

1210
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:55,401
No way.

1211
01:03:55,564 --> 01:03:57,920
Duk Joong, who told you that?

1212
01:03:57,944 --> 01:03:59,044
What?

1213
01:03:59,234 --> 01:04:00,666
Where did you hear about it?

1214
01:04:00,995 --> 01:04:03,283
"Machine Gun Parade March."

1215
01:04:03,745 --> 01:04:04,933
It's an animated film.

1216
01:04:04,995 --> 01:04:06,141
Darn you.

1217
01:04:06,165 --> 01:04:08,827
- It's a masterpiece.
- Goodness.

1218
01:04:11,044 --> 01:04:12,730
You deserve a beating, you fool!

1219
01:04:12,754 --> 01:04:15,141
- Get this!
- You little...

1220
01:04:22,305 --> 01:04:23,492
Seriously...

1221
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:26,081
- Get this!
- Does this hurt?

1222
01:04:26,105 --> 01:04:28,290
- Hey!
- Get this!

1223

What is going on here?

1224
01:04:37,904 --> 01:04:39,004
Where are you going?

1225
01:04:39,234 --> 01:04:40,435
I have to study.

1226
01:04:44,495 --> 01:04:46,420
You're not allowed to go off on your own.

1227
01:04:46,785 --> 01:04:48,181
If you want to study, do it here.

1228
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:50,174
They're too loud. I can't focus here.

1229
01:04:54,214 --> 01:04:57,008
Kwon Il Ha over there has his cell phone.

1230
01:05:02,174 --> 01:05:05,111
You're not allowed to keep your cell phone. Did you not know that?

1231
01:05:07,305 --> 01:05:08,460
Hand it over.

1232
01:05:13,024 --> 01:05:14,168
Go, hurry.

1233
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:25,029
You violated the rules for cell phone use.

1234
01:05:25,325 --> 01:05:26,700
You get three penalty points.

1235
01:05:26,955 --> 01:05:28,187
Okay, sure.

1236
01:05:34,455 --> 01:05:36,984
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

1237
01:05:37,424 --> 01:05:38,568
We can talk now.

1238
01:05:40,214 --> 01:05:42,070
You little piece of...

01:05:42,094 --> 01:05:43,326
What are you doing?

1240
01:05:48,435 --> 01:05:49,766
Follow me, both of you.

1241
01:05:54,274 --> 01:05:55,649
Darn it.

1242
01:05:58,524 --> 01:05:59,811
It's all your fault, idiot.

1243
01:06:01,614 --> 01:06:04,221
- Come on, guys.
- Let's go.

1244
01:06:04,654 --> 01:06:05,899
Darn it.

1245
01:06:06,205 --> 01:06:07,437
Gosh.

1246
01:06:08,325 --> 01:06:11,262
Hold it properly, will you? It's splashing all over me.

1247
01:06:12,955 --> 01:06:16,309
This is why you have no friends. What a loser.

Hey.

Seriously, what's your problem?

1251
01:06:27,975 --> 01:06:30,121
Hey. You're really getting on my nerves, you little jerk.

1252
01:06:30,145 --> 01:06:33,027
Hey, got a death wish?

1253
01:06:33,185 --> 01:06:34,648
Gosh, he's at it again.

1254
01:06:38,814 --> 01:06:42,750
Hey, do you know that everyone thinks you're obnoxious? You loser.

1255
01:06:42,774 --> 01:06:44,886
That's rich coming from someone who plays bully.

1256
01:06:45,285 --> 01:06:46,704
You gangster want-to-be.

1257

Oh, your family must be happy...

1258

- Hey! Please.
- Move.

1263

- Hey, please.
- Let go.

1264
01:06:59,924 --> 01:07:01,690
- Please don't do this.
- Why you little...

1265
01:07:01,714 --> 01:07:03,900
- You stupid piece of...
- Please, guys.

1266
01:07:03,924 --> 01:07:06,630
Please stop. Hold on.

Hey, guys.

What is that? That thing.

Can't you tell?

1271
01:07:49,424 --> 01:07:50,900
It's the sphere.

1272

I've never seen one right in front of my eyes.

1273

- Hey, wait!
- Why?

1274
01:07:58,935 --> 01:08:01,410
Don't. It could be dangerous.

1275

Darn it!

1276

I got my phone taken away because of that loser.

If I post this, my follower count will skyrocket.

It really is too bad.

1279
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:19,394
Is that right?

1280
01:08:19,455 --> 01:08:22,227
Then why don't you post videos of yourself bullying the others?

1281
01:08:22,464 --> 01:08:24,202
Those videos will go viral too.

Well...

State your class, student number, and name.

1293

Then say a few words to your parents and friends...

1294

You can just...

say a few words to your parents.

Is Cyberpia Internet Café still around?

Oh, that place?

1300
01:10:24,125 --> 01:10:25,101
That's random.

1301
01:10:25,125 --> 01:10:26,874
Why? Did they go out of business?

1302

No, it's still there.

I see.

1304
01:10:33,715 --> 01:10:36,013
Do they still cook instant noodles for you?

1305
01:10:37,135 --> 01:10:39,477
- Yes.
- What about the egg yolk?

1306
01:10:41,345 --> 01:10:42,543
They pop it.

1307
01:10:43,974 --> 01:10:45,129
Still?

1308
01:10:45,524 --> 01:10:48,210
They really shouldn't pop the yolk.

1309
01:10:48,234 --> 01:10:50,478
The owner always forgets.

1310

You know, that game...

01:11:00,285 --> 01:11:02,947
Is my ID still saved as one of your friends?

1312
01:11:03,665 --> 01:11:06,558
Yes, of course.
