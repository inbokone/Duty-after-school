Gunshots.

4
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:31,723
- Those are gunshots, right?
- Yes.

5
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:35,290
Seems like it. Did something happen?

6
00:00:36,473 --> 00:00:37,660
Let's head outside.

7
00:00:38,552 --> 00:00:39,751
We'll know then.

Hey.

Cho Jang Soo.

10
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:56,132
What are you doing?

11
00:00:57,322 --> 00:00:59,247
What? No.

12
00:00:59,862 --> 00:01:01,106
- Don't do it.
- Wait.

13
00:01:03,332 --> 00:01:05,429
Hey!

14
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:07,245

Hey.

16
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:14,062
That scared me!

17
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:18,963
What is that thing?

18
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:22,073
I don't know.

19
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:36,208
- I'm not going.
- Come on. Hurry up.

20
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:37,469
No. I don't want to.

21
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:39,648
Darn it. Get moving. The exit is over here.

22
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,001
No, I'm not going.

23
00:01:44,493 --> 00:01:45,593
Follow me.

24
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:47,430
- Darn it.
- Don't go.

25
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:50,234
Seriously.

26
00:02:00,383 --> 00:02:02,813

Hey. What the heck are you thinking, you idiot?

30

Let go of me, punk.

Hey. Try it with your finger.

- My finger?
- Yes.

34
00:02:58,403 --> 00:03:00,415
That tickles. It tickles.

35
00:03:02,572 --> 00:03:03,629
It really tickles.

36
00:03:03,653 --> 00:03:04,896
- It does?
- Again.

37

41

Hey. What is it?

45

No. Hey. Im Woo Taek.

- What?

00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:13,621
- Let's go.
- Okay.

63
00:05:15,703 --> 00:05:17,451
- Let's go already.
- Okay.

64

Didn't you hear me? Go!

74
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:36,343
Darn it! Hurry up and evacuate!

75

- Hurry up and shoot the sphere!
- I'm scared.

80

- Hurry up.
- The gun won't work.

82

- Why won't you shoot?
- The gun won't work, you idiot!

83
00:06:58,263 --> 00:06:59,999
You were trained to shoot.

84
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:01,628
It won't work, okay?

How did this happen?

99
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:02,294
I've contacted the nearby unit to recover the bodies.

100
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:11,389
Did you give them bullets?

101
00:09:11,943 --> 00:09:13,548
Yes. Three each.

102
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:31,201
What you saw today...

103
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:35,107
are the divisions of the sphere that fell from that sky.

104
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:39,061
Those separated smaller spheres...

105
00:09:39,882 --> 00:09:41,489
attack people...

106
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:45,212
and devour them.

107
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,368
"Devour them?"

00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:50,230

- Yes.
- Yes.

118
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:29,762
Don't shoot!

148
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:18,228
happen now?

149
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:20,228
You will either be transferred to another unit...

150
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:22,439
or get discharged early if you want.

154
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:35,213
Reserve forces and even civilians will be drafted.

155
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:38,235
There's a chance even high school seniors will be drafted.

156
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,706
Even students?

157

Imagine all of them up there dropping down.

159
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:52,799
The number we have now will be nowhere enough then.

160
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:54,428
But they are still students.

161
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,978
- Will they accept the situation?
- We will make them accept it.

163

164
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,185
We can never hold the CSAT.

165
00:15:09,882 --> 00:15:11,807
You know that better than anyone, sir.

166
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:13,699
They will all die in vain.

167
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:15,703
They will die even if they don't do anything.

168
00:15:15,892 --> 00:15:17,774
At least give them guns.

00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:39,409
- What is that?
- What?

174
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,699
- What is that?
- Come.

175
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:42,966
Go inside!

176
00:16:43,272 --> 00:16:44,248
What do you think you are doing?

177
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:46,248
- Go inside!
- Go inside!

178
00:16:46,272 --> 00:16:47,618
- Go inside!
- Move!

179
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:49,853
- Go inside!
- Run inside!

180
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:51,589
I said, run inside!

(Mathematics, Type Ga)

183
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,072
This isn't...

184
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:10,573
a dream, right?

185
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:14,445
Did Ms. Park...

186
00:17:15,962 --> 00:17:17,162
really...

187
00:17:18,843 --> 00:17:19,986
Really...

188
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:31,357
(Yoo Ha Na)

189
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:34,095
I am sorry.

190
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:37,421
I didn't intentionally not open the car door.

191
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:40,082
I was scared.

192
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:45,138
Never mind. I'm not in the mood to talk to you.

193
00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:47,598
I am sorry, Bo Ra.

194
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:50,195
I am going home.

195
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,928
I can't stay here any longer.

196
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:56,780
So Yeon.

197
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,279
I am going home too.

198
00:17:58,303 --> 00:18:01,108
Darn it. In the end, they just want us to fight that thing.

199
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:02,658
- Darn it.
- Right. I'm going home too.

200
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,029
Will you stop acting like a child?

201
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:06,618
I don't care about college or getting extra points for CSAT.

202
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:08,709
Will you think before you act?

203
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,613
Don't just pack up your bag right away.

204
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:13,248
Never mind. I am going too.

205
00:18:14,313 --> 00:18:16,842
- I'm going too.
- Don't go.

206
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,294
Hey. Don't do this.

207
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:23,928
I'm going home.

208
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:25,141
Sit.

209
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:28,033
Screw that.

210
00:18:29,122 --> 00:18:30,266
Sit!

211
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:44,618
Take a seat first.

212
00:18:57,323 --> 00:18:58,741
It's dangerous outside.

213
00:18:59,192 --> 00:19:02,503
School is the safest place for now.

214
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:05,181
Safe?

215
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:07,285
Our homeroom teacher died.

216
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:09,547
And we heard Young Hoon died too.

217
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,348
And you call that safe?

218
00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:14,100
Being protected by someone else doesn't mean you will be safe.

219
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:16,328
You have to protect yourself.

220
00:19:16,462 --> 00:19:18,858
And school is training you to do that.

221
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:20,489
But you saw us. We can't even shoot a gun.

222
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:21,788
So how can we...

223
00:19:23,803 --> 00:19:25,276
How can we protect ourselves?

224
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:27,698
Just send us home.

225
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:29,603
We will stay put at home.

226
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:31,603
Then we will be all right, right?

227
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,883
Please send us home.

228
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:36,347
I want to go home.

229
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:41,010
Right.

230
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,008
Let's say you went home.

231
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:48,833
What if the spheres attack your home?

232
00:19:50,872 --> 00:19:52,098
What will you do then?

233
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:53,497
(Lee Soon Yi)

234
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:03,428
The night training will be held as scheduled.

235
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:04,951
- What?
- What?

236
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:07,234
Better get ready for it.

237
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:12,355
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

238
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:15,982
Darn it.

239
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,819
Despite what the platoon commander said,

240
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:22,566
some of you must still want to go home.

241
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:30,439
I think we should either all go together...

242
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:32,827
or...

243
00:20:34,872 --> 00:20:36,204
all stay together.

244
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:39,863
I think nothing will come of it if we don't come to an agreement.

245
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:43,115
You all saw it.

246
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:45,059
Platoon commander is right.

247
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:47,856
If we go outside like this, we will fall prey to the spheres.

248
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:52,448
I'd rather stay here than die miserably outside.

249
00:20:52,472 --> 00:20:55,618
Darn it. What difference does it make if we stay here though?

250
00:20:55,642 --> 00:20:56,868
Let's just go!

251
00:20:56,892 --> 00:20:58,418
Did you hear what he said?

252
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:00,209
We have to act as a team.

253
00:21:00,233 --> 00:21:01,878
If you think about it,

254
00:21:01,902 --> 00:21:02,918
all of this happened because you didn't act as a team, you know.

255
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:04,548
Darn it.

256
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:06,628
What did you just babble about, Bo Ra?

257
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:07,928
You want me to babble about some more?

258
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:09,509
Is it time to quarrel?

259
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:12,888
What then? What do you suggest we do?

260
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:14,475
What do you want me to do?

261
00:21:14,622 --> 00:21:17,835
Right. It was our fault.

262
00:21:18,372 --> 00:21:19,527
Hee Rak,

263
00:21:20,003 --> 00:21:22,895
it was our fault, you know. Right?

264
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:26,210
Let go, you idiot.

265
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:37,628
Guys.

266
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:40,297
I am sorry.

267
00:21:44,023 --> 00:21:45,178
So you are saying...

268
00:21:45,612 --> 00:21:48,009
it's better to stay here together?

269
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:50,338
Let's not get too extreme.

270
00:21:50,362 --> 00:21:52,009
Let's hear what everyone has to say.

271
00:21:52,033 --> 00:21:54,259
Hear what everyone has to say? What for?

272
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:55,428
Just take a vote.

273
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:56,597
Whether we will go...

274
00:21:57,622 --> 00:21:58,821
or stay.

275
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:04,019
All right. Let's decide by show of hands.

276
00:22:04,043 --> 00:22:06,110
Who thinks we should go home?

277
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:13,989
You darn idiots.

278
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:15,938
- Won't you raise your hands?
- Kimchi.

279
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:30,549
Darn it.

280
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:33,510
- Il Ha!
- You selfish jerk.

281
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:35,716
Raise your hand.

282
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:37,098
I said raise your hand!

283
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,559
- Stop it, Il Ha.
- Say what?

284
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,848
Everyone has their own opinion and story.

285
00:22:40,872 --> 00:22:43,677
What story? The extra points?

286
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:46,577
Even if your homeroom teacher and your classmate died,

287
00:22:46,753 --> 00:22:49,349
you are happy as long as you get the extra points for CSAT?

288
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,297
How about you then?

289
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:55,268
Why didn't you say anything when you knew about Young Hoon?

290
00:22:55,513 --> 00:22:57,899
If you told us, things would have changed.

291
00:22:58,603 --> 00:23:01,023
He was an outcast, and we never cared about him anyway.

292
00:23:02,483 --> 00:23:03,583
Or did you care?

293
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:05,767
You must've been happy.

294
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:07,609
Your ranking will go up once he's gone.

295
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,475
Darn it!

296
00:23:16,283 --> 00:23:17,844
We gathered to have a discussion,

297
00:23:18,412 --> 00:23:19,700
not to fight.

298
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:23,899
So what is your brilliant idea?

299
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,422
Should we all die here?

300
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:27,583
Darn it!

301
00:23:27,793 --> 00:23:28,904
Hey.

302
00:23:29,593 --> 00:23:32,343
We are not real soldiers, are we?

303
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:35,273
I am going home.

304
00:23:35,803 --> 00:23:37,198
If you want to stay, stay all you want.

305
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:39,698
That's why we should discuss it and come to an agreement.

306
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:41,428
I don't know about other things.

307
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:43,959
I just can't stand her. Send her away.

308
00:23:46,853 --> 00:23:48,378
Why are you blaming Ae Seol?

309
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:51,571
We won't die because of the spheres. We will die because of her.

310
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:53,259
That's why we should send her away.

311
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:55,064
We have to come together.

312
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:56,994
Why do you keep trying to fight?

313
00:23:57,662 --> 00:23:58,851
You all saw it.

314
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:01,734
After all we've been through, nobody asked...

315
00:24:03,503 --> 00:24:04,778
if we are all right...

316
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:06,911
and how tough it must have been.

317
00:24:07,672 --> 00:24:09,597
Did anyone ask that?

318
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:12,529
That's who we always have been.

319
00:24:12,593 --> 00:24:14,110
When it comes to CSAT,

320
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:17,011
we can't say anything.

321
00:24:17,182 --> 00:24:18,326
Right.

322
00:24:20,182 --> 00:24:22,845
They know that CSAT is our weak spot.

323
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:26,382
Right.

324
00:24:27,152 --> 00:24:29,308
Let's stop getting fooled by what the adults say.

325
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,387
Right.

326
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:42,288
Let's take a vote again by show of hands.

327
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:51,005
Who thinks we should go home?

328
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:14,083
Guys...

329
00:25:14,823 --> 00:25:15,923
Yes?

330
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:18,623
Something terrible has happened,

331
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,258
but what if nothing happens after this?

332
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,428
We'll be the only ones who don't get additional points.

333
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:28,212
If so, I'll be at a huge disadvantage...

334
00:25:28,503 --> 00:25:29,878
- Hey!
- Kwon Il Ha!

335
00:25:30,043 --> 00:25:32,979
You can wait a million years, but the CSAT won't happen for you.

336
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:34,202
Raise your hand.

337
00:25:34,422 --> 00:25:35,938
Raise your hand, you piece of crap!

338
00:25:35,962 --> 00:25:37,819
- Stop that.
- You jerk!

339
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:40,618
- Let go of me. Get back here!
- Stop it.

340
00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:43,436
- Stop that.
- Let go of me!

341
00:25:53,273 --> 00:25:54,559
Young Soo.

342
00:25:56,112 --> 00:25:57,575
I'm begging you.

343
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,115
I can't stay here anymore.

344
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:02,061
I'm...

345
00:26:03,122 --> 00:26:04,585
I'm too scared.

346
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:07,837
Let me go to my mom, Young Soo.

347
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:09,583
Please!

348
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,595
(Operation Sphere Removal)

349
00:26:39,112 --> 00:26:41,092
(Concentrated in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province)

350
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:43,299
(Sungjin High School 2nd Semester)

351
00:26:43,323 --> 00:26:45,621
(November 18: Day of CSAT)

352
00:27:08,182 --> 00:27:09,948
The whole class agreed on this.

353
00:27:09,972 --> 00:27:11,749
(Petition)

354
00:27:11,773 --> 00:27:13,279
We all want to go home.

355
00:27:24,702 --> 00:27:26,122
It was just one.

356
00:27:28,162 --> 00:27:30,912
Just one sphere killed hundreds of soldiers.

357
00:27:32,162 --> 00:27:36,156
The area is now crawling with spheres,

358
00:27:36,382 --> 00:27:37,934
so how do you expect to go home?

359
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:43,813
Even if you do go home,

360
00:27:45,382 --> 00:27:48,408
- your parents won't be there.
- What?

361
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:50,368
A nationwide evacuation order has been issued.

362
00:27:50,392 --> 00:27:53,517
They will have arrived at the shelter by now.

363
00:27:57,813 --> 00:28:00,244
That's crazy. Are you sure?

364
00:28:00,942 --> 00:28:02,142
You're lying, aren't you?

365
00:28:03,743 --> 00:28:06,799
Can't you take us to the shelter as well?

366
00:28:06,823 --> 00:28:08,660
You are current soldiers of the military,

367
00:28:08,993 --> 00:28:10,554
and we are at war.

368
00:28:11,243 --> 00:28:12,651
You may not leave as you please.

369
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:19,295
So don't get any ideas...

370
00:28:19,593 --> 00:28:20,824
and prepare for training.

371
00:28:29,892 --> 00:28:32,367
Are you kidding me?

372
00:28:36,392 --> 00:28:37,592
Seriously?

373
00:28:59,962 --> 00:29:01,062
Are you okay?

374
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:04,265
Shut it.

375
00:29:07,263 --> 00:29:08,451
What?

376
00:29:09,142 --> 00:29:10,908
What are you looking at?

377
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:13,957
I'm worried, that's all.

378
00:29:14,103 --> 00:29:17,490
So what if you are, you prick?

379
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:21,925
Young Hoon's death...

380
00:29:23,902 --> 00:29:26,102
- isn't on you, so...
- Hey.

381
00:29:26,323 --> 00:29:27,929
Run your mouth again,

382
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:30,762
and I'll kill you myself.

383
00:29:40,122 --> 00:29:41,827
Pick up the pace!

384
00:29:42,503 --> 00:29:43,647
Faster!

385
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:46,853
Run faster.

386
00:29:48,472 --> 00:29:51,355
You'll be as good as dead if you run like this.

387
00:29:51,932 --> 00:29:53,165
Run!

388
00:29:54,182 --> 00:29:55,788
Run if you wish to survive.

389
00:29:58,603 --> 00:29:59,746
Run!

390
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:01,438
Get moving, Private.

391
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:03,261
Run.

392
00:30:04,273 --> 00:30:05,604
Keep guns pointed up.

393
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:07,220
Run faster!

394
00:30:07,942 --> 00:30:09,548
Run if you wish to live.

395
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:13,469
Run!

396
00:30:14,162 --> 00:30:16,825
You'll be as good as dead if you run like this.

397
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:18,652
Keep going.

398
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,809
Get up and move if you want to live.

399
00:30:22,793 --> 00:30:24,079
Private No Ae Seol,

400
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:26,274
do you wish to be a burden on your friends?

401
00:30:28,632 --> 00:30:29,920
No, sir!

402
00:30:30,472 --> 00:30:31,661
Then, run.

403
00:30:31,972 --> 00:30:33,072
Run!

404
00:30:35,103 --> 00:30:36,789
- Keep moving if you want to live.
- Darn it!

405
00:30:36,813 --> 00:30:39,057
No one will protect you.

406
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:41,484
Don't be a burden on your friends.

407
00:30:43,192 --> 00:30:44,887
Run if you wish to live.

408
00:30:46,692 --> 00:30:48,298
Move faster.

409
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:51,282
No one will protect you.

410
00:30:51,493 --> 00:30:52,912
Survive on your own.

411
00:30:53,323 --> 00:30:55,302
Keep moving if you wish to live.

412
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,476
Run!

413
00:31:02,462 --> 00:31:04,849
Private. Get running.

414
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:07,326
Run if you wish to live!

415
00:31:11,422 --> 00:31:12,666
I can't.

416
00:31:14,763 --> 00:31:18,205
No, I can't.

417
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:22,900
Commander, I can't.

418
00:31:23,442 --> 00:31:28,304
I can't do this anymore.

419
00:31:50,172 --> 00:31:51,503
I'm scared.

420
00:31:57,763 --> 00:31:59,512
This never made sense from the start.

421
00:31:59,682 --> 00:32:01,442
How could we go through this training...

422
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:03,694
and take the CSAT at the end of the year?

423
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:07,518
We were too naive like a bunch of fools.

424
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:10,749
Hey, we weren't the ones who were naive.

425
00:32:10,773 --> 00:32:12,290
The adults wronged us.

426
00:32:14,493 --> 00:32:15,912
That platoon commander...

427
00:32:16,452 --> 00:32:18,466
enjoys torturing us.

428
00:32:19,283 --> 00:32:21,119
And here I thought he was a good person.

429
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:25,612
Don't think that way about the platoon commander.

430
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:29,922
Darn it!

431
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:33,948
The training will kill me at this rate, not the spheres!

432
00:32:35,513 --> 00:32:36,888
You'll find out later on...

433
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:38,730
that the platoon commander...

434
00:32:40,553 --> 00:32:42,026
is watching out for you.

435
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:58,152
As if.

436
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:09,079
The spheres are immune to weapons of mass destruction.

437
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:12,315
And with rifles, all we can do is slow them down.

438
00:34:14,902 --> 00:34:18,026
Only depleted uranium ammunition has been working on them so far.

439
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:19,264
Depleted uranium ammunition?

440
00:34:19,532 --> 00:34:21,271
But only on those small ones.

441
00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:23,234
Those medium-sized seem to be immune.

442
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:42,868
But the problem is this.

443
00:34:43,222 --> 00:34:44,784
We don't have enough ammo,

444
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:47,539
and we lack in the number of rifles...

445
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:48,982
that can shoot the spheres.

446
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:51,377
That is why...

447
00:34:53,313 --> 00:34:55,425
we had to recruit high school seniors.

448
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:09,866
Okay.

449
00:35:13,713 --> 00:35:15,550
The coast is clear. We're free to talk.

450
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:23,366
Must we stay like this?

451
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:25,683
We don't have any other option.

452
00:35:25,762 --> 00:35:27,005
Darn it.

453
00:35:27,262 --> 00:35:31,212
Honestly, I don't believe that our parents went to the shelter.

454
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:33,499
What if he lied to make us stay?

455
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:35,591
As if the platoon commander...

456
00:35:39,782 --> 00:35:41,796
He isn't one to lie.

457
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:43,097
Darn.

458
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:46,905
I want to believe him, but I don't trust anyone anymore.

459
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:53,291
Let's confirm it ourselves.

460
00:35:53,963 --> 00:35:55,107
How stupid are you?

461
00:35:55,213 --> 00:35:57,644
We can't call, and the Internet is down.

462
00:35:58,383 --> 00:36:01,594
And that is your limit. Of course, we can still communicate.

463
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:04,352
Is there a way to contact them?

464
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:08,052
What do we have a lot of in school?

465
00:36:09,892 --> 00:36:10,992
I don't know.

466
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,478
Pigeons.

467
00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:17,039
We'll tie a note around their legs and...

468
00:36:17,063 --> 00:36:18,350
Somebody shut him up.

469
00:36:19,483 --> 00:36:21,133
Let's rewind it a few steps.

470
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:23,771
We have no other option but to confirm it ourselves.

471
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:28,217
Here. I'll go.

472
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:30,388
Kimchi, shouldn't you go as well?

473
00:36:30,412 --> 00:36:32,388
Me? Why me?

474
00:36:32,412 --> 00:36:34,481
Your house is the closest.

475
00:36:34,622 --> 00:36:36,118
It's the easiest place to confirm.

476
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:38,663
- But...
- Chi Yeol will come with.

477
00:36:39,173 --> 00:36:40,769
But I'm not ready for this.

478
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:42,311
- Duk Joong.
- Yes?

479
00:36:45,423 --> 00:36:47,633
Our house is quite far away.

480
00:36:50,552 --> 00:36:52,433
(Restroom)

481
00:37:07,363 --> 00:37:09,243
- We'll break out from here.
- What?

482
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:11,594
How can one go through there?

483
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:15,530
Jang Soo and I won't be able to manage,

484
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:17,103
so I'm off.

485
00:37:23,423 --> 00:37:26,502
This is a school of history and tradition.

486
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:27,700
What could I mean by that?

487
00:37:32,222 --> 00:37:34,334
- Why you...
- It's old.

488
00:37:34,972 --> 00:37:36,128
Watch.

489
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:40,700
I get it. What?

490
00:37:42,113 --> 00:37:43,301
Careful.

491
00:37:44,273 --> 00:37:45,472
Careful.

492
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:49,557
Darn it.

493
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:58,897
Be careful.

494
00:37:59,293 --> 00:38:00,393
Be careful.

495
00:38:13,142 --> 00:38:14,286
Follow me.

496
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:25,591
We're going too?

497
00:38:26,443 --> 00:38:27,641
Jang Soo!

498
00:38:40,793 --> 00:38:42,036
Quick!

499
00:38:42,463 --> 00:38:43,899
You should go next.

500
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:46,309
Darn it.

501
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:51,488
Hey, are you all right?

502
00:38:51,512 --> 00:38:52,931
Just get out now.

503
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:02,188
- Hey!
- Just come out now.

504
00:39:02,233 --> 00:39:03,652
Do we really have to do this?

505
00:39:09,653 --> 00:39:10,939
Darn.

506
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:14,959
Hey, are you okay?

507
00:39:15,572 --> 00:39:16,959
Is it Duk Joong?

508
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:19,870
- Darn it.
- Darn it.

509
00:39:23,122 --> 00:39:25,609
Come out now. What are you doing?

510
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:41,153
Be quiet.

511
00:40:05,713 --> 00:40:07,132
Shoot.

512
00:40:12,633 --> 00:40:13,733
Where are they going?

513
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:15,278
Go.

514
00:40:15,302 --> 00:40:16,677
Get down.

515
00:40:18,353 --> 00:40:20,684
- Shall we go now?
- Yes.

516
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:24,540
Oh, my.

517
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:26,118
Who's it there?

518
00:40:26,142 --> 00:40:28,717
- Goodness.
- Sorry. What shall we do?

519
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:31,013
- Duk Joong.
- Yes?

520
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:34,089
You must be curious why you're here even when your home is not close.

521
00:40:34,113 --> 00:40:35,630
What? Yes.

522
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:38,092
I'm sorry.

523
00:40:38,782 --> 00:40:39,981
Why?

524
00:40:40,622 --> 00:40:41,810
Hey!

525
00:40:45,162 --> 00:40:46,262
Duk Joong.

526
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:50,318
Hey!

527
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:52,899
What are you doing here at this hour... What did you eat?

528
00:40:52,923 --> 00:40:54,121
I didn't eat anything...

529
00:41:01,182 --> 00:41:02,326
Why?

530
00:41:02,722 --> 00:41:03,948
- That thing...
- What is it?

531
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:05,868
What's wrong?

532
00:41:05,892 --> 00:41:07,368
What is it?

533
00:41:07,392 --> 00:41:08,789
Catch me if you can!

534
00:41:08,813 --> 00:41:10,969
That punk... Hey!

535
00:41:12,443 --> 00:41:14,235
- Let's move.
- Let's go.

536
00:41:18,322 --> 00:41:19,840
- Oh.
- Gosh.

537
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,439
What on earth are you doing here?

538
00:41:24,912 --> 00:41:28,675
Hey, do you want to run?

539
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:34,528
If I do that, you should...

540
00:41:34,552 --> 00:41:36,448
Gosh, what are you saying?

541
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:37,660
"What are you saying?"

542
00:41:38,222 --> 00:41:40,103
- Follow me if I...
- What?

543
00:41:40,842 --> 00:41:43,618
You idiots...

544
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:45,567
- What?
- You idiots...

545
00:41:45,682 --> 00:41:47,158
Run, idiots...

546
00:41:47,182 --> 00:41:50,175
- Run, idiots.
- Run, idiots.

547
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:52,053
Run, idiots!

548
00:41:55,032 --> 00:41:57,548
- Go!
- Run now!

549
00:41:57,572 --> 00:41:59,640
- Duk Joong!
- Where are you going?

550
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:05,178
Run fast!

551
00:42:05,202 --> 00:42:06,848
Run!

552
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:07,888
Hey!

553
00:42:07,912 --> 00:42:10,618
- Wait!
- Run!

554
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:18,839
Stop following us!

555
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:21,028
Stop there!

556
00:42:21,052 --> 00:42:22,368
Stop!

557
00:42:22,392 --> 00:42:24,361
- Stop!
- Quick!

558
00:42:30,563 --> 00:42:32,499
Sir, everything is fine!

559
00:42:32,523 --> 00:42:33,629
Any movements on the sphere?

560
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:35,919
Everything is fine so far. We'll keep watching.

561
00:42:35,943 --> 00:42:38,758
- Duk Joong!
- Gosh!

562
00:42:38,782 --> 00:42:40,894
- Stop!
- Gosh.

563
00:42:41,613 --> 00:42:42,718
What are you doing? Come here.

564
00:42:42,742 --> 00:42:44,810
- Run!
- Run.

565
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:47,133
What is it?

566
00:42:57,092 --> 00:42:59,609
Catch them!

567
00:42:59,633 --> 00:43:01,513
Catch them...

568
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:04,081
Did you catch them?

569
00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:10,494
I caught Duk Joong.

570
00:43:14,653 --> 00:43:15,885
Oh my...

571
00:43:16,983 --> 00:43:18,048
Second platoon, roll to the right.

572
00:43:18,072 --> 00:43:19,629
- To the right!
- To the right!

573
00:43:19,653 --> 00:43:20,629
To the right!

574
00:43:20,653 --> 00:43:22,379
- To the right.
- Sorry.

575
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:23,428
Roll to the left.

576
00:43:23,452 --> 00:43:25,377
- To the left!
- To the left!

577
00:43:26,742 --> 00:43:28,718
- Stand up.
- Yes, sir!

578
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:29,942
Stand up!

579
00:43:32,662 --> 00:43:33,774
Okay.

580
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,214
From now on, you're not students.

581
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:41,350
I'll treat all of you as soldiers now.

582
00:43:41,802 --> 00:43:43,266
You can't act like a baby...

583
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:46,219
and have no privilege as a student.

584
00:43:47,222 --> 00:43:51,172
You have to follow every order I give...

585
00:43:52,892 --> 00:43:54,136
as soldiers.

586
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:57,127
Do you understand?

587
00:43:57,563 --> 00:43:59,089
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

588
00:43:59,113 --> 00:44:00,508
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

589
00:44:00,532 --> 00:44:01,508
Second platoon, lie face down.

590
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:03,169
- Face down!
- Face down!

591
00:44:03,193 --> 00:44:04,339
Face down!

592
00:44:04,363 --> 00:44:06,067
Face down!

593
00:44:06,782 --> 00:44:08,894
- One!
- One!

594
00:44:09,122 --> 00:44:11,559
- Two!
- Two!

595
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:12,770
Focus!

596
00:44:14,372 --> 00:44:15,616
Gosh.

597
00:44:16,003 --> 00:44:19,446
Does anyone still want to go home?

598
00:44:22,052 --> 00:44:24,714
- Second platoon, stand up.
- Stand up!

599
00:44:30,012 --> 00:44:32,300
From now on, if you get out of here, it's desertion.

600
00:44:33,392 --> 00:44:35,230
And you'll be tried by court-martial.

601
00:44:49,162 --> 00:44:53,809
From this very minute, anyone who leaves without permission,

602
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:55,395
will be considered as a deserter...

603
00:44:58,043 --> 00:44:59,407
and may be shot under my order.

604
00:45:41,963 --> 00:45:44,075
Has the platoon commander gone really crazy?

605
00:45:44,253 --> 00:45:45,399
Are they really going to shoot us?

606
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:48,733
No way. They won't really shoot us.

607
00:45:50,222 --> 00:45:51,454
But what if they do?

608
00:45:51,472 --> 00:45:53,408
It will hurt so bad.

609
00:45:53,432 --> 00:45:54,807
When you get shot,

610
00:45:55,773 --> 00:45:57,742
the bullet hole is small in the front...

611
00:45:59,892 --> 00:46:02,312
but it's as large as a watermelon in the back. I heard.

612
00:46:02,903 --> 00:46:04,872
That's a lie.

613
00:46:06,032 --> 00:46:07,176
Is that true?

614
00:46:08,742 --> 00:46:10,304
You can try and see.

615
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:13,358
Are you really going to stay put?

616
00:46:13,952 --> 00:46:15,809
But there's no other way.

617
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:19,809
We should either endure this or hold up.

618
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:21,483
Aren't those the same thing?

619
00:46:22,253 --> 00:46:24,090
To endure and to hold up.

620
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:29,448
So, that's the only way, I mean.

621
00:46:30,742 --> 00:46:32,073
There's a way.

622
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:38,836
There's a way we can try.

623
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:01,998
Young Hoon is dead.

624
00:47:02,022 --> 00:47:03,339
What?

625
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:04,826
He's dead.

626
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:08,339
Hey, you know Young Hoon, right?

627
00:47:08,363 --> 00:47:10,299
- We do.
- Yes.

628
00:47:10,323 --> 00:47:12,308
I'm not lying.

629
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:14,348
See? I was almost dead.

630
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:15,979
Just right there...

631
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:17,553
What was the reason?

632
00:47:19,923 --> 00:47:21,529
I'm leaving.

633
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,913
- Wait.
- Let's talk for a minute.

634
00:47:24,253 --> 00:47:25,364
Let me go.

635
00:47:27,593 --> 00:47:29,430
We might all end up dead.

636
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,658
Hey, come here quickly!

637
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:32,078
- What is it?
- Quick!

638
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:33,908
I heard Ms. Park and Young Hoon are dead.

639
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:36,038
- What?
- What?

640
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,748
That alien or something did that!

641
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,538
Is what students in Class Two saying true?

642
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:42,248
- Is it?
- Is it?

643
00:47:42,272 --> 00:47:43,944
Is the CSAT only an excuse you made...

644
00:47:44,022 --> 00:47:46,589
and are you trying to make us fight against the spheres?

645
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,538
- You should tell us!
- Teacher, tell us!

646
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:49,678
- What's happening?
- What's your plan?

647
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:52,452
- What's going on?
- Calm down!

648
00:48:02,253 --> 00:48:05,927
My class will follow what your class does.

649
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:07,452
Thank you.

650
00:48:07,923 --> 00:48:10,354
- Just give us the signal.
- Okay.

651
00:48:19,852 --> 00:48:21,327
(Confidential)

652
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:23,942
- Thank you.
- It's mine.

653
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,508
I think you should get some sleep.

654
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:35,806
What about the kids?

655
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:40,421
They have a lot of complaints.

656
00:48:44,173 --> 00:48:45,273
You know,

657
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:50,168
after what happened, isn't this too much?

658
00:48:50,633 --> 00:48:54,439
You know how it feels to lose a colleague.

659
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,038
It's hard for us.

660
00:48:58,312 --> 00:49:00,050
It must be even harder for the kids.

661
00:49:01,812 --> 00:49:05,618
We need to give them time to mourn and console them.

662
00:49:07,943 --> 00:49:09,351
There's no time to console them.

663
00:49:10,403 --> 00:49:14,209
If I can save one more kid, I can be even harsher than this.

664
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:22,263
Let's go. The kids are waiting.

665
00:49:24,622 --> 00:49:25,866
Let's go!

666
00:49:26,332 --> 00:49:27,319
Let's go!

667
00:49:27,343 --> 00:49:29,229
- Come out!
- Let's go!

668
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:30,989
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

669
00:49:31,013 --> 00:49:33,359
Let's go and take our freedom!

670
00:49:33,383 --> 00:49:34,698
- Let's go!
- Gosh!

671
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,448
- Move over!
- Let me go!

672
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:38,158
Stop them!

673
00:49:38,182 --> 00:49:40,338
Quick!

674
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,118
Block them! You punk, move over!

675
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:45,498
Push them back!

676
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:46,959
You punks!

677
00:49:46,983 --> 00:49:49,129
Push them back!

678
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:51,549
Block them!

679
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:54,642
Go back inside!

680
00:49:54,823 --> 00:49:56,065
Darn it!

681
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:00,275
You punks...

682
00:50:01,662 --> 00:50:03,638
What are you doing? Go back to your classroom!

683
00:50:03,662 --> 00:50:06,229
- I heard Ms. Park is dead.
- She's dead!

684
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:08,609
I heard it from the kids in Class Two!

685
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:10,319
- I heard everything!
- Is that true?

686
00:50:10,343 --> 00:50:12,609
I don't want to die!

687
00:50:12,633 --> 00:50:14,649
Jang Young Hoon of Class Two is dead too.

688
00:50:14,673 --> 00:50:16,908
- Please send us home!
- Send us home.

689
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:17,989
- Now!
- Let us go home.

690
00:50:18,013 --> 00:50:19,529
Who said so?

691
00:50:19,553 --> 00:50:20,739
- Gosh.
- Let's push through.

692
00:50:20,763 --> 00:50:21,868
Gosh, what?

693
00:50:21,892 --> 00:50:24,136
What are you doing?

694
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:29,930
Stop the kids!

695
00:50:30,772 --> 00:50:32,654
What are you waiting for?

696
00:50:32,983 --> 00:50:34,759
Stop them!

697
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:35,879
Why wouldn't you let us go?

698
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,190
Why these little...

699
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:42,069
Listen.

700
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:45,138
Doing this won't do you any good.

701
00:50:45,162 --> 00:50:46,729
You won't get any extra points...

702
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,439
for your college entrance exams.

703
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:49,899
Look, mister.

704
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:52,439
I don't care, so just let me go home!

705
00:50:52,463 --> 00:50:53,739
You'll get penalty points, you punk.

706
00:50:53,763 --> 00:50:55,448
Thanks for that.

707
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:56,529
- Let's go!
- Okay!

708
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,709
Don't you dare!

709
00:50:58,892 --> 00:50:59,989
Let us go!

710
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:01,113
Stop!

711
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:03,129
What are you doing?

712
00:51:03,682 --> 00:51:05,244
What do you think you're doing?

713
00:51:06,312 --> 00:51:07,643
Go back inside now.

714
00:51:10,102 --> 00:51:12,919
Doing this won't change anything. Hurry back inside!

715
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:14,629
Why must we do that?

716
00:51:14,653 --> 00:51:16,169
We aren't even soldiers.

717
00:51:16,193 --> 00:51:17,879
I already told you. This is all for your...

718
00:51:17,903 --> 00:51:19,651
We don't need it.

719
00:51:20,872 --> 00:51:22,841
If it's for our sake, let us go.

720
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:25,737
Why can't we have anything our way?

721
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:28,905
Why can't we do what we want?

722
00:51:45,472 --> 00:51:46,847
What are you waiting for?

723
00:51:47,233 --> 00:51:49,058
Force them back inside if you must!

724
00:51:49,522 --> 00:51:50,578
Stop them.

725
00:51:50,602 --> 00:51:51,977
- Get them inside now.
- No!

726
00:51:52,272 --> 00:51:53,419
- Move!
- I'm going to go home.

727
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,049
- Let us go!
- Goodness.

728
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:57,339
Stop them.

729
00:51:57,363 --> 00:51:58,650
No!

730
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,182
Stand up.

731
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,858
What on earth?

732
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,940
Focus.

733
00:52:39,492 --> 00:52:40,912
Everyone, ready to fire.

734
00:52:42,702 --> 00:52:45,177
Go forward.

735
00:53:12,233 --> 00:53:14,664
Go back inside. Quickly!

736
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:17,913
Hurry inside.

737
00:53:24,912 --> 00:53:26,562
Run.

738
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,552
Protect the students!

739
00:54:01,823 --> 00:54:03,561
Pull yourself together!

740
00:54:03,653 --> 00:54:04,896
Run!

741
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:12,736
Move out of the way!

742
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:15,605
Move! Darn it.

743
00:54:38,863 --> 00:54:40,095
Shoot them.

744
00:54:59,582 --> 00:55:00,819
What are you doing?

745
00:55:00,843 --> 00:55:02,162
Pull yourselves together!

746
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:15,408
Sir, it's me. Open the door for me.

747
00:55:15,432 --> 00:55:16,618
Go away, you fool.

748
00:55:16,642 --> 00:55:17,868
Go kill those spheres.

749
00:55:17,892 --> 00:55:19,092
Now!

750
00:55:19,772 --> 00:55:21,104
Open the door.

751
00:55:21,153 --> 00:55:23,959
- Sir, please open the door.
- Darn it.

752

Sir, you son of a gun!

754
00:55:29,283 --> 00:55:30,471
Move!

755
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:08,129
Go out.

756
00:56:08,153 --> 00:56:09,879
They're over there. Go that way.

757
00:56:09,903 --> 00:56:11,638
- They're there too.
- Go out that way.

758

Go that way.

Hey, get up.

Are you okay?

Are you all right?

We must go.

776
00:57:58,803 --> 00:58:00,684
Run straight to the classroom.

Close the doors.
