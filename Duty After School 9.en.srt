1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,590
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,799
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,060
- Yes. - We're all getting out!

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,519
We should capture one of them and hear them out.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,560
Got it.

6
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:16,940
They wouldn't have gotten far, so spread out and search.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,440
Wouldn't they have made a run for it?

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,570
I don't know what they have in mind,

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,699
but they won't leave her behind.

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,280
They don't seem like your average school buddies,

11
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:30,660
but I don't know what their story is.

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,409
- Tell me about it. - Right.

13
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,170
Let's get on our separate ways.

14
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,579
The doors were unlocked, and there isn't a problem.

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,750
Look here, mister. Unbelievable.

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,460
How stupid can you be?

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,719
We should find out what's going on outside.

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,880
- I'm not interested. - Is that so?

19
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,509
Then, you should be on your way.

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,310
You'll be heartbroken...

21
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,020
if your mother isn't at the nursing home.

22
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,100
I mean...

23
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:58,060
- Hold on. - Hey.

24
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,770
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,939
I asked my boys outside to look out for your mother.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,569
Don't you dare lay a finger on her,

27
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:09,870
you sick psycho.

28
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,909
It's why we should help each other out.

29
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,170
Come on, darn it. Stop being so scary.

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,879
What are you glaring at me for?

31
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,060
After I get you the kids,

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,060
we won't see each other again.

33
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,650
Sure thing.

34
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,109
I don't care about the boys, so kill them all.

35
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,689
- Only bring the girls. - Sure.

36
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:46,780
What was her name again? Right, it was Bo Ra.

37
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,280
Make sure she isn't harmed in any way.

38
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,030
She's one I must groom.

39
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,290
It's been a while, and I'm getting excited.

40
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:56,909
Darn.

41
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,129
The one with the glasses is more my type though.

42
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,629
I see you like those in glasses. Go ahead, then.

43
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:06,719
You can take that one if you want.

44
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,469
- She's too docile, which is boring. - Okay.

45
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,219
Get up, will you?

46
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,060
Hey.

47
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:17,479
Hey, keep walking.

48
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,479
I must've lost weight while not being able to eat and all.

49
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,229
My pants keep slipping down.

50
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:23,819
Let's hurry up and eat.

51
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,110
I'll enjoy my meal and also the one with glasses.

52
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,740
Gosh, it's nice to be out,

53
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,159
but the fine dust...

54
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,289
Are you really going off on your own?

55
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,539
- What a moron. - What? Unbelievable.

56
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,340
Hey, hairy guy.

57
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,629
Wait for me, hairy guy. Are we going this way?

58
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:57,219
Shoot.

59
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,889
Keep yourself hidden down to your strands of hair

60
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,150
Kids, where are you?

61
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,229
Let's play.

62
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,110
Here you are!

63
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,610
I guess not.

64
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,199
Kill...

65
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,830
the boys.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,289
While the girls...

67
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,870
There they are.

68
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Darn it.

69
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,139
Stop.

70
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,599
(Infirmary)

71
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,789
Hey, shouldn't we finish up what we started earlier?

72
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,080
Why don't we swap clothes?

73
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,590
Would it kill you to give me a livelier response?

74
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,840
Kids!

75
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,970
Where are you going?

76
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,149
This has been my home for years, you know.

77
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,439
I know this place like the back of my hand.

78
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,110
Darn, you're not here.

79
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,990
Why aren't you here?

80
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,449
You little turds.

81
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,629
Keep yourself hidden

82
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,629
Down to your strands of hair

83
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,720
What...

84
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,019
Are you kidding me, you little freaks?

85
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,149
Where the heck are you? Get out here!

86
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,779
What the heck?

87
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,459
You little cow.

88
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,550
Darn it.

89
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:37,259
You ugly little cow.

90
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,009
Get back here, you cow! Darn it!

91
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,850
What the...

92
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,810
Hey! Get back here!

93
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,980
You little cow.

94
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,519
Are you kidding me?

95
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:55,439
Don't waste my energy and get out here, darn it.

96
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,529
Open up.

97
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,410
You little cow!

98
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,990
Are you kidding me?

99
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,660
Get out here!

100
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:04,699
Darn cow.

101
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,250
Get out here!

102
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:14,709
Who's there?

103
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,550
What the heck is that?

104
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,189
Darn it!

105
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,610
Darn...

106
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:36,939
What the...

107
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:40,449
No...

108
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,079
I see he screams when he has orgasms.

109
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,079
You darn morons.

110
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,040
How hard is it to catch a couple of kids?

111
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:54,879
Are you kidding me?

112
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,170
Darn it!

113
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,389
It has begun.

114
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,680
Oh, no.

115
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,389
Will the others be all right?

116
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,350
Hang in there, Ae Seol.

117
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,769
Wait, is that a sphere?

118
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,029
- Where did it come from? - There are four of them.

119
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,610
- And they're drawing near. - Oh, no.

120
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,029
At this speed, they'll reach the building in minutes.

121
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,199
We have no choice. We should let them go.

122
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,120
Wait.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,670
This might be our way to save Ae Seol.

124
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,430
Lure the spheres your way while we get to Ae Seol.

125
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,970
And be careful.

126
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,980
Will it be okay? We'll all be in danger.

127
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,189
There's no other way at this point.

128
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:55,810
It'll work out.

129
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:58,819
Ae Seol is stronger than you think.

130
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:18,750
- Okay, let's open this door. - Hurry.

131
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,000
- You must have the keys. - Unlock it.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,589
- Hurry, will you? - There we go.

133
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,009
And then...

134
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,759
The door will now open.

135
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:46,070
- Did it work? - We need the rest inside.

136
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,080
- You pricks! - You pricks!

137
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,250
Here they come.

138
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,509
Who knew I'd be playing Tag with them?

139
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:09,720
Just don't let them catch up.

140
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,139
Are you telling me you're not getting horny?

141
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,149
There's no need to be on full Rambo mode.

142
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,899
No one's here.

143
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,029
The one with the glasses seems to like the color white...

144
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,240
like the gray in my hair.

145
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
What?

146
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,830
I'm also armed, you freak.

147
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:38,000
What? I'll shoot, darn it.

148
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,559
Anyway, the one with the glasses likes the color white...

149
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,850
like the gray in my hair.

150
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:58,309
Where are you going?

151
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,159
What the...

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,049
If you keep moving about on your own,

153
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,009
I won't let you have fun.

154
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,879
What on earth?

155
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,840
Did the kids do this?

156
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,090
I think someone else is in play.

157
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,600
Something isn't right.

158
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,269
I can't take it anymore. I'm leaving.

159
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,269
What the heck is this? Darn it.

160
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,399
My gosh.

161
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,330
Get off me!

162
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:05,879
Darn it!

163
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,590
Save me! Do something!

164
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,720
Oh, my gosh.

165
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:14,100
Save me!

166
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,340
Jerk.

167
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,360
For goodness' sake. Bo Ra.

168
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,149
You couldn't hold it in and moved on your own?

169
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,649
Stupid No Ae Seol is alone.

170
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,690
Jerks.

171

Let's go.

172
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,500
- We have to get out immediately. - Why? What's going on?

173
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,629
Everyone's attacked.

174
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:09,840
Those little brats?

175
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,919
It's not the kids.

176
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,629
Then who?

177
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,049
I don't know.

178
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,720
I think it's a weird monster.

179
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,549
A monster?

180
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,720
What are you talking about?

181
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,389
You jerk. Did you kill them?

182
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:28,100
I saw it with my own eyes.

183
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:30,769
We need to get out quick. If you want to live.

184
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:34,190
What are you talking about? Darn it!

185
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,370
What's that?

186
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,710
Gosh. Hey.

187
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,710
Hey. Be careful. Hey.

188
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,960
Hey! Shoot!

189
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:01,470
Why isn't it dying? Hey! Look at this.

190
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,929
- Hey. Oh, gosh. - Gosh!

191
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,139
For goodness' sake.

192
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,809
Shoot. What is it?

193
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,690
Darn it!

194
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,809
He got what he deserved.

195
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,480
Let's hurry and find Ae Seol and get out of here.

196

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,919
For goodness' sake. Where is she?

- No Ae Seol! - Yes?

204
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,960
- Bo Ra. - Are you okay?

205
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,460
- No Ae Seol! - Ae Seol!

206
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,299
You're okay, right?

207
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,669
Yes, I'm okay.

209
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,230

You witch. Seriously!

241
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,339
Shoot. You brat. I'll kill you.

242

Yes. Shoot them all.

243

What are you doing standing there doing nothing? You fool!

246

Shoot them! Shoot to let them meet their moms. You fool.

247

Shoot them! Darn it!

250
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,089
I was curious...

251
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,059
why those appeared out of nowhere.

252
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,349
I think I know why now.

253
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,769
It's because humans...

254
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,319
are trash.

255
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,240

Do you think...

331
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,180
he committed suicide because he couldn't handle the pain?

332
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,269
Someone also committed suicide at the garrison due to depression.

No, it's not suicide.

I'm going to keep trying until my feelings get accepted.

There's no way he would've committed suicide.

00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:54,269
Do you think the others will be understanding?

341
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:58,309
Gosh.

342
00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:00,809
Is anyone there?

343
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:09,869
What?

344
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,490
Earlier...

345
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,420
No way.

346
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,799
There's no way.

347
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,930
That can't be true. Think about it.

348
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,809
They broke it on purpose? How does that make sense?

349
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:35,930
What if it's true?

350
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,309
If it's true, who in the world broke it?

351
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,019
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

352
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:46,440
- They must be here. - Hey.

353
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,950
Let's keep it to ourselves for now.

354
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,779
- Why? - Hey, it could end up...

355
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,369
creating tension between everyone.

356
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,410
Let's tell Yu Jung at a later time.

357
00:26:57,579 --> 00:26:58,579
She's right.

358
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,710
We don't even know what actually happened with the walkie-talkie.

359
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,750
Fine.

360
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,049
- I don't know. - Seriously.

361
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:08,759
Bo Ra got hurt pretty bad.

362
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,220
I feel like I'm going to die.

363
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,799
Darn it, we have to deal with criminals on top of spheres.

364
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,549
Hey, it just happens like that.

365
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,720
- Stop being so annoying. - Come on.

366
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:19,940
Oh, my gosh! Yeon Bo Ra, are you okay?

367
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,440
- What? - Be quiet. Stop making a fuss.

368
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,230
Yeon Ju isn't here. What should we do?

369
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,019
Oh, right. Emergency first aid.

370
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,940
Bo Ra, let's go.

371
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,740
I'll take care of it on my own.

372
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:34,069
Bo Ra, just go and get treated.

373
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,829
Let go. I can walk on my own.

374
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,130
- Hey. - Don't bother me.

375
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,839
Did something happen?

376
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,299
How did Bo Ra get hurt?

377
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,309
Were there a lot of spheres?

378
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,140
It wasn't the spheres.

379
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,230
What? Then what was it?

380
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:09,859
But why weren't you guys keeping watch?

381
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,650
- What? - Well...

382
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,910
The thing is...

383
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:17,119
something came up.

384
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:23,829
Right. Did you guys find a walkie-talkie?

385
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,170
- Darn it. - Darn it.

386
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,750
No, there weren't any.

387
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,130
You said there would be!

388
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:33,589
You were so confident!

389
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:35,339
Why are you raising your voice?

390
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,470
Hey, is that our fault?

391
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,849
- We almost died. - Darn it.

392
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:42,930
Why?

393
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,849
What happened?

394
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:48,190
Forget it. I'm too exhausted...

395
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,109
to talk right now.

396
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,740
Hey.

397
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,619
We said we'd keep it to ourselves.

398
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,119
All right.

399
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,380
I'll rub the ointment now.

400
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:23,349
Thanks.

401
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,769
And sorry for acting on my own.

402
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,900
My body just reacted instinctively.

403
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,400
Stop trying to build a relationship with me.

404
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,740
I couldn't help it.

405
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,039
After my parents got divorced,

406
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,130
no one wanted to raise me, so I was left with my grandma.

407
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:56,259
I never said I was curious.

408
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,009
I'm just making an excuse...

409
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,519
because I'm so sorry.

410
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:09,309
- Hey. - Yes?

411
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,480
Didn't I hurt my ear?

412
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,779
Sorry. I'll wrap it again.

413
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,160
It's okay. I'll ask Yeon Ju to help me later.

414
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,829
By the way...

415
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,759
Never mind.

416
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,640
What's that look on your face?

417
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,809
- Are you okay? - Do you think so? I got shot.

418
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,690
Yeon Bo Ra, at the penitentiary, No Ae Seol...

419
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,109
You don't have to explain.

420
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,240
Bo Ra.

421
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:07,500
I was shocked earlier.

422
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:11,079
I didn't die. Are you my boyfriend or what?

423
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,539
Why were you shocked?

424
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,130
Why? Do you want me to be your boyfriend?

425
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:21,890
What are you saying?

426
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,599
- Hey. - The others are back. Let's go.

427
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,930
- You guys went through a lot. - Yes.

428
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,099
- Guys, you're here. - You're here.

429
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,599
- Soon Yi! - Good work.

430
00:31:32,769 --> 00:31:34,269
- Soon Yi, Yeon Ju. - What's wrong?

431
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,859
- What's wrong, Yeon Ju? - Soon Yi, Yeon Ju.

432
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:38,359
- What is it? - What's going on?

433
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,529
- What is it? - What?

434
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,529
- What? - What's going on?

435
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,240
What is this?

436
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,460
Where's Soo Chul?

437
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,670
Come on. Answer us.

438
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:01,839
Why aren't you saying anything? You're making me anxious!

439
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:02,970
Hey, Kwon Il Ha.

440
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,049
Why aren't you talking?

441
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:07,849
Chi Yeol.

442
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,750
No.

443
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:42,339
What happened?

444
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:44,930
Say something!

445
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:53,430
(Convenience store)

446
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:05,319
Soo Chul...

447
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,910
Soo Chul.

448
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,369
Poor Soo Chul.

449
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,630
Poor Soo Chul.

450
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,509
Soo Chul...

451
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,769
What's this?

452
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,190
The ballot Soo Chul had.

453
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:42,400
There were three dissenting votes.

454
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,240
Tell me why Soo Chul...

455
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:47,990
had these.

456
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,490
What the...

457
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:54,789
What are these?

458
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,920
Why are the dissenting votes here?

459
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,299
I voted against staying yesterday.

460
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,089
The fact he hid these...

461
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:06,720
was to fool us into thinking that more voted to stay.

462
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:08,130
Who fooled us?

463
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,969
Are you saying that Soo Chul did?

464
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,300
What are you talking about?

465
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,900
I asked Soo Chul to destroy the ballots.

466
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,400
That must be why he had them.

467
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,199
Why did he only have ballots that were against the idea?

468
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,699
And three of them?

469
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:31,320
It's proof that the poll was rigged.

470
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,530
Don't jump to conclusions.

471
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,949
Soo Chul had no reason to do that.

472
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,659
What are you all barking about?

473
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:37,869
Tell me so that I can understand.

474
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:39,170
Guys, hold on.

475
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,710
Why are we suspecting one another?

476
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,250
This will only lead to misunderstandings.

477
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,550
Then let's get to the truth right now.

478
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,880
If the poll wasn't rigged,

479
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,340
today's poll will produce the same result.

480
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,340
Raise your hand if you voted X.

481
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,389
Hey.

482
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,059
We shouldn't be raising hands...

483
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,309
Why are you stopping us?

484
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,679
Wang Tae Man,

485
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,639
you're acting awfully suspicious.

486
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,690
What?

487
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,309
You've been losing your cool today,

488
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,820
- and I'd rather you shut your trap. - Shut my trap?

489
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,070
- That's right. - Hey!

490
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,650
- What? - I can swear too, you know.

491
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,989
Go ahead, then.

492
00:35:08,989 --> 00:35:10,699
Guys, stop.

493
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:11,860
What the...

494
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:15,369
Unbelievable.

495
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:17,539
Darn it.

496
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,670
Let's calm down and talk this out.

497
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,090
Soo Chul...

498
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,750
How did he die?

499
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,010
Squad Two, don't you know anything?

500
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,139
Say something.

501
00:35:39,389 --> 00:35:40,559
Soo Chul...

502
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,400
I heard him argue before dying.

503
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,610
- What? - What?

504
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,070
Soo Chul...

505
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,110
- What if it weren't an accident? - Kim Chi Yeol.

506
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,780
What on earth are you saying?

507
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,329
Who did Soo Chul argue with?

508
00:35:55,409 --> 00:35:56,489
Are you sure about it?

509
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:58,750
Why are you only mentioning it now?

510
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,670
I was too startled earlier to put two and two together.

511
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,539
It's why I didn't say anything.

512
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,250
What on earth is going on?

513
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,920
First,

514
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:13,010
we must know who Soo Chul argued with in the hospital.

515
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,099
Tell me...

516
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:20,519
where you were...

517
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,980
and what you were doing at the time.

518
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,230
What?

519
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,070
Are you suspecting us?

520
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,230
Are you out of your mind? You're asking for our whereabouts?

521
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,030
Tell us where you were first!

522
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,150
Why should we believe you, anyway?

523
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,739
I'm not saying we should suspect each other.

524
00:36:33,739 --> 00:36:36,159
We should at least find out how Soo Chul died.

525
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:37,239
Then...

526
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:40,619
What you're saying is that...

527
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,329
one of them...

528
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,500
killed Soo Chul.

529
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,420
- What? - Ha Na, watch your mouth...

530
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,630
and don't say whatever comes to mind.

531
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,929
What if Soo Chul didn't trip and fall?

532
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,179
It means someone killed him.

533
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:57,510
As if that makes sense!

534
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,469
Stop it. My head's about to explode.

535
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:07,650
Let's first confirm what we can.

536
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,530
We have proof that the poll was rigged,

537
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,530
so let's figure that out first.

538
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:19,989
Kim Yu Jung, tell us. You probably know what's going on.

539
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:24,829
Why won't you tell us? Speak up!

540
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:26,500
Don't badger her like that.

541
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,340
Jang Soo, maybe you were in on it as well.

542
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,460
- This isn't time to take sides. - Hey, don't.

543
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,380
Tae Man, why are you advocating for them?

544
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,550
- Maybe you're in on it too. - I'm in on it too?

545
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,849
Hey, don't push your luck.

546
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:40,349
Having a mouth doesn't mean you can say anything.

547
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:42,389
- Darn you. - Guys, let's calm down.

548
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:44,389
She's right. We're too worked up.

549
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,099
How can one not be?

550
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,400
We almost died today.

551
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,860
If that isn't the case, explain yourself.

552
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,440
Answer the darn question!

553
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,320
- You! - That's enough!

554
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,739
Let go of me, you jerk.

555
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,239
This has been a touchy issue for you today.

556
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,369
You were in on it for sure!

557
00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:01,869
- Why you... - Don't!

558
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:02,949
- Hey. - You jerk.

559
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,079
What was that, you jerk?

560
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,409
- Kim Chi Yeol! - Hey!

561
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,579
- How dare you? - You started it.

562
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,079
You jerk!

563
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,550
- That's enough! - Have you lost it?

564
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,670
- What? - That's enough!

565
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:27,730
- Kwon Il Ha. - Hey.

566
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,730
It was me.

567
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,280
Soo Chul...

568
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:42,530
and I...

569
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,159
have been rigging the polls.

570
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,960
Kwon Il Ha, what are you saying?

571
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,719
Is this true?

572
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,389
Soo Chul and I...

573
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:07,179
were scared at first and wanted to leave.

574
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:10,980
But the fear only fueled our anger.

575
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,059
We wanted to wipe out the spheres!

576
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,190
You feel the same way, don't you?

577
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,239
What? You fooled us...

578
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:20,530
just to keep hunting the spheres?

579
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:22,280
What are you barking on about?

580
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,119
Of course you're angry, but...

581
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,409
Kwon Il Ha, are you out of your mind?

582
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:30,039
How could you two have done that, though?

583
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,250
It would've taken more than you two to rig them.

584
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:43,719
It...

585
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,179
It's all my fault.

586
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:48,719
It was my idea.

587
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,269
You darn prick!

588
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,940
Answer me, you prick!

589
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,610
Who was it? Who else was in on it?

590
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,239
Answer me, darn it!

591
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,400
Guys.

592
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:03,570
I'm sorry.

593
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:06,909
Kim Yu Jung?

594
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,170
And Cho Jang Soo?

595
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,800
What on earth?

596
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:29,559
Why would you do this?

597
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:33,190
Were you all in on it?

598
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,980
Kim Yu Jung and Cho Jang Soo.

599
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,940
I don't want to believe it.

600
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,110
Is this why you suggested a poll?

601
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:47,070
No, they wouldn't have.

602
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:48,699
Right?

603
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:51,659
Tell us, Yu Jung. Tell us!

604
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,409
Why can't you say anything?

605
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,960
Tell us why you fooled us this second!

606
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,170
Tell us!

607
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,179
I couldn't put us all in danger.

608
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,349
What are you talking about?

609
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,769
Is it true that you deceived us?

610
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,820
That's insane.

611
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,239
It can't be. I...

612
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:27,159
Why, though?

613
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:28,699
Because...

614
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,079
Because...

615
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,090
Because the CSAT was canceled.

616
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,210
What?

617
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:44,670
Kim Duk Joong, what are you saying?

618
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,050
- What was that? - What?

619
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,219
- Kim Duk Joong. - What did he just say?

620
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,469
What do you mean by that?

621
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:51,429
Why was the CSAT canceled?

622
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,269
That's right. The CSAT was canceled.

623
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,980
The other units must've received the radio message.

624
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,440
Don't you lie to us.

625
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,110
That's a lie, isn't it?

626
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,949
It's true.

627
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,789
I knew it, darn it!

628
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:15,579
No.

629
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:18,329
The CSAT hasn't been canceled. Who said that?

630
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,090
It's a lie, isn't it?

631
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,420
There's no way the CSAT would've been canceled.

632
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,469
Young Soo, calm down.

633
00:42:26,469 --> 00:42:27,969
Tell me that it's a lie!

634
00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:29,260
Kook Young Soo!

635
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,510
The CSAT was already canceled when the spheres first landed.

636
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,849
But how is that important right now?

637
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:37,769
It's more important than my life! Darn it!

638
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,599
Don't you know what life until now...

639
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,150
has been designed around?

640
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,360
So don't you lie to me.

641
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:50,909
Don't you lie, darn it!

642
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,039
Duk Joong, please.

643
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:01,079
Please tell me it's not true.

644
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,670
Duk Joong.

645
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,920
Duk Joong, please.

646
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:10,889
Duk Joong, please.

647
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:16,559
Is it true that the CSAT...

648
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:18,389
was canceled?

649
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:21,559
How did you hear about it when we've lost communication?

650
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,320
(Yongdu Service Area)

651
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,409
Kids from the science high school came by today.

652
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:41,289
They received a radio message about the CSAT being canceled...

653
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:44,500
and were on their way to Seoul.

654
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,710
We said we didn't hear about it...

655
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,380
because our radio died.

656
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,599
And?

657
00:43:58,309 --> 00:44:00,480
They opened it up to fix it for us,

658
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:03,099
only to find that someone had sabotaged it.

659
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,650
What are you talking about? Are you serious?

660
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,570
Someone deliberately took it off the circuit board.

661
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,900
What?

662
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:13,860
Darn it.

663
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:25,250
Why would someone do that?

664
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,380
Who?

665
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,139
Hey. Hey!

666
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:40,429
Did you all do this too?

667
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:42,349
Explain it!

668
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:45,480
You broke the walkie-talkie to hide the cancellation of CSAT?

669
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,190
You rigged the vote too!

670
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,110
This is absurd.

671
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,570
Why are there so many issues?

672
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,530
Does anyone have more? Tell me if you have.

673
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:55,659
Say something! Darn it!

674
00:44:56,489 --> 00:44:59,159
We've worked so hard to fix the walkie-talkie.

675
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:02,199
You saw everything. Why did you do it?

676
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,329
Why?

677
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:06,670
Did you want us to die all together?

678
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,750
Say something! Why?

679
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,469
The CSAT isn't canceled.

680
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:21,519
I doubted it...

681
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,599
when I heard the news from the walkie-talkie.

682
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,769
Even if it was true, I didn't want to believe it.

683
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,440
Why did you lie to us?

684
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,860
Was it important to kill...

685
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,199
more spheres whether we get killed or not?

686
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:41,699
Are you insane? Are you crazy?

687
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,880
Explain this situation right now.

688
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,840
What's all this nonsense?

689
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:58,340
The day we heard the news of CSAT cancelation,

690
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:01,809
Soo Chul and I...

691
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,179
were on guard.

692
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,150
- What? - I told you.

693
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,730
It has been decided to cancel the CSAT this year.

694
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,360
The extra points you've earned so far will be applied next year.

695
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,409
So keep the operation going without any deserter. Over.

696
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:23,329
What? Wait. Hello?

697
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:25,869
Hello? Wild Goose. This is Seagull.

698
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,579
Wild Goose. Respond!

699
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,170
Darn it...

700
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:39,679
What nonsense is this?

701
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,800
The CSAT is canceled, but they want to keep the operation going?

702
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:49,190
How many of us got killed until today?

703
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:51,940
Now the CSAT is canceled.

704
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,110
They kept us by using extra points.

705
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,480
The jerks are doing whatever they want to.

706
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,989
They must think of us as pushovers.

707
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,449
Darn it.

708
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:01,409
Darn it!

709
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:08,039
Where are you going?

710
00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:11,079
What do you mean? I shall tell others.

711
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,920
Wait.

712
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,510
Let's do this instead.

713
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,320
Is it okay to do this?

714
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,449
If they find out, they'll want to go home.

715
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:42,110
It doesn't make sense to go to Seoul at this point.

716
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:48,619
- But... - Tell me.

717
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,750
Kwon Il Ha. Did you stay because of the CSAT?

718
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,460
No, right?

719
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:56,920
You didn't care about extra points.

720
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,170
Why did you stay?

721
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:02,719
For goodness' sake.

722
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:10,679
This isn't up to adults.

723
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:14,349
It's up to us.

724
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,440
I need to end this war.

725
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,860
I'll kill all the spheres.

726
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:24,989
Then I want to go back to school.

727
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:29,619
So we broke the walkie-talkie.

728
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,869
Soo Chul and I were going to keep the secret to ourselves.

729
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,420
But...

730
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,050
(Yongdu Service Area)

731
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,840
There's only one vote difference.

732
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:46,599
At this rate, there will be more votes to go to Seoul.

733
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,679
We promised that since the start.

734
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:54,309
It's more dangerous to go now. You know that too.

735
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:56,900
There's no way to communicate.

736
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,820
What's the point of continuing the duty?

737
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,280
No.

738
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:04,659
We need to follow the operational order until we get through.

739
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:07,239
There'll be more spheres as we get closer to Seoul.

740
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:09,409
It's better to stay here since we're used to being here.

741
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:11,659
There is some food for us to last here too.

742
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,789
The others got adjusted too.

743
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,460
If we leave the operational area at our disposal...

744
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,300
and don't join them,

745
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,469
we'll be in big trouble.

746
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:27,719
You're right. But...

747
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,050
Let's...

748
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:31,719
make a yes vote...

749
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:34,599
in advance for the next voting.

750
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,150
You want to manipulate the vote?

751
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,860
Just until we fix the walkie-talkie.

752
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:42,230
We don't know which area is safe. We can't just move without a plan.

753
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,610
Otherwise, we'll all be in danger.

754
00:49:48,909 --> 00:49:50,949
I don't want to see...

755
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:53,500
anyone dying again.

756
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:06,630
Okay.

757
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,139
Just until we fix the walkie-talkie.

758
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:12,679
Just until then.

759
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,780
What are you doing up at this hour?

760
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:33,289
I agree with the vote rigging.

761
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:36,829
But it will be hard for you two to do it.

762
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,500
We'll help.

763
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,039
No. Guys...

764
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,920
I broke the walkie-talkie.

765
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,920
What? What are you talking about?

766
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:48,130
Are you crazy?

767
00:50:48,929 --> 00:50:49,929
Wait.

768
00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:00,019
They can only find us through radio.

769
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:02,650
- They aren't coming. - How do you know that?

770
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,940
The CSAT is canceled.

771
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,150
- What? - The CSAT is canceled.

772
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:08,900
But they want us to continue with the operation.

773
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:13,119
You get what it means, right?

774
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:15,659
To adults, we're just tools.

775
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,659
They have no intention to protect us.

776
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,039
Not at all.

777
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,590
I don't care if we're just a tool.

778
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,630
I'm not going to Seoul.

779
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,710
I'm not sure...

780
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:31,550
if I'll be able to...

781
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:33,889
face my dead friends.

782
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,940
I thought it was nonsense at first.

783
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,530
But think about it.

784
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,400
This place is relatively safe.

785
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,659
It's too dangerous to go to Seoul.

786
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:53,530
Then is it not dangerous to stay here forever?

787
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:55,159
There are less spheres here.

788
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:56,739
We have food to endure for a while too.

789
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:58,000
Stop lying!

790
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:01,789
Hey. What are you trying to do?

791
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:04,840
What's the reason you're keeping us all here?

792
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,630
You could've told us the truth from the start.

793
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,849
I thought you'd be upset if you found out...

794
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,599
that the CSAT was canceled.

795
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,019
The CSAT?

796
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:25,769
Hey. Darn it. What about having the CSAT canceled?

797
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,030
Why would that matter at this point?

798
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,690
Do you think CSAT kept us to live like this?

799
00:52:31,699 --> 00:52:33,409
Why didn't you ask our opinions?

800
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,619
Why?

801
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:37,829
Who are you to do that?

802
00:52:41,369 --> 00:52:42,369
I'm sorry.

803
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,420
Darn it.

804
00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:54,719
I can't believe you all now.

805
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,349
Did you kill Soo Chul because he wanted...

806
00:52:58,599 --> 00:52:59,929
to tell the truth?

807
00:52:59,929 --> 00:53:01,980
- Are you insane? - Yes, we are!

808
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,190
I'm going crazy because of you all.

809
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:05,440
We saw it today.

810
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,860
Humans are scarier than the spheres.

811
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:09,570
You all are...

812
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:13,320
the same as the criminals.

813
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,000
I've really...

814
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,670
thought about it...

815
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,460
hundreds of times.

816
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,179
About the way we can all be together.

817
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:39,969
The platoon commander said...

818
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:41,889
that we have to protect each other.

819
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:45,099
That's how we can survive until the end.

820
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:49,610
But once you hear that CSAT is canceled,

821
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,989
I thought you would all scatter.

822
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:59,199
So I wanted to keep you all using the CSAT.

823
00:54:02,289 --> 00:54:03,329
I'm sorry.

824
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,289
I thought we should stick together...

825
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,210
even by taking severe measures.

826
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,130
Guys...

827
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,929
We...

828
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:23,010
We need to survive.

829
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:25,309
Right?

830
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,650
I'm sorry.

831
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,730
I didn't mean to lie to you from the start.

832
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:42,869
You should have...

833
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,909
told us that in the first place.

834
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,420
You should've...

835
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,550
discussed it with all of us.

836
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:05,679
Now, it's too late.

837
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:25,639
Now,

838
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:29,389
what do we do?

839
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,610
We should go to the shelter, where our parents are.

840
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,320
How would we know where that is?

841
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,570
We'll have to look for it.

842
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:49,659
You know...

843
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:54,460
Do you think Soo Chul actually died in an accident?

844
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,460
Or did something happen to him?

845
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,590
Beats me.

846
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:07,679
Only Soo Chul will know.

847
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,139
But why?

848
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:19,150
Who?

849
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,400
There's no evidence.

850
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,280
You might regret it...

851
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,820
once you doubt someone.

852
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,659
Why did the adults...

853
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:37,460
give us rifles?

854
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,550
They should have stopped us from holding them.

855
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,630
(Yongdu Service Area)

856
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,050
Compared to when we first grabbed our rifles,

857
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,840
how much will we have changed...

858
00:59:51,429 --> 00:59:53,510
by now?

859
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:59,230
All we did was barely survive every day,

860
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,150
and we were already turning 20 soon.

861
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,530
What awaits us at the end of this road?

862
01:00:10,489 --> 01:00:12,570
If we safely make it home,

863
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:16,619
can we go back to how we were before we used these rifles?

864
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:26,380
That day,

865
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,050
we should not have left the service area.

866
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,800
(Duty After School)

867
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:36,389
Next.

868
01:00:36,389 --> 01:00:37,679
(Reservist number 1, Kook Young Soo)

869
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:40,769
Aren't you tired?

870
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:45,019
Of course, I am.

871
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:47,570
But we're not here to hang out.

872
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,610
Our mission is to eliminate the spheres.

873
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,739
We can go back once we finish the mission.

874
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,909
That's true, but everyone is exhausted...

875
01:00:57,989 --> 01:00:59,659
after the platoon commander died.

876
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,579
We just need to remember our training.

877
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,579
Let's be honest.

878
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,920
I bet all seniors in this country have similar extra points.

879
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,340
Then, what would be the point?

880
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:15,550
I have to finish the mission to stay on top.

881
01:01:17,889 --> 01:01:19,599
Don't underestimate those extra points.

882
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:21,349
It will make a difference in the end.

883
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:23,639
You'll take the CSAT to go to college after this, won't you?

884
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:29,110
Well, I guess so.

885
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,190
But...

886
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,199
Young Soo, why are you so obsessed with college?

887
01:01:38,409 --> 01:01:41,449
Well, people normally say,

888
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:43,039
"I'd like..."

889
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:47,000
"my family to stay the same."

890
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:50,460
But I want the opposite.

891
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,380
What do you mean by that?

892
01:01:55,630 --> 01:01:59,050
My mom and dad work from dawn till dusk.

893
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,679
When they come home, we don't have the luxury of talking.

894
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:03,559
They just go straight to bed.

895
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:05,519
And at dawn,

896
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:09,059
while my parents groan in pain,

897
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:11,400
I study with earplugs on.

898
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,449
Sure, war is dreadful.

899
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,409
But do you know what's more dreadful?

900
01:02:21,949 --> 01:02:23,119
It's poverty.

901
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:25,829
You guys don't know...

902
01:02:26,289 --> 01:02:28,289
what it's like to be really poor.

903
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,130
My family...

904
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:39,260
can never work our way out of this destitution...

905
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:43,059
unless we win the lottery ticket.

906
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,599
For my younger siblings to go to college as well...

907
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:53,650
and talk about what happened that day at the table...

908
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,489
To have that normal life...

909
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,409
that's insignificant to others,

910
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:06,789
I must get accepted by a good college...

911
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:10,880
and get a job at a good company.

912
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,760
Can you delete this video?

913
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:23,179
I shouldn't have said those.

914
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:26,309
I'll do the interview next time.

915
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:51,170
